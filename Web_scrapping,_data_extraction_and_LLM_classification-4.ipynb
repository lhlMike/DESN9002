Why? Just Following Orders?Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia was a driver for mortality - found in a new study from April 2023. \\\\\"Unsuccessful treatment of VAP is associated with greater mortality.\\\\\" They always knew what was killing most patients. Yet ventilators and refused antibiotics continue to this day. David Dickson March 12, 2020 “Ventilators kill if not used appropriately, and for COVID 19 - there is never an appropriate time. But let\\'s buy more especially from those experts in the medical equipment field such as vacuum cleaner and car manufacturers… Will they go through years of double-blind studies to make sure they are safe?” April 5, 2020 “Why does the world suddenly need millions of ventilators, when doctors continue to report that almost if not all patients who are intubated and placed on a ventilator ultimately die? What then is the point? Yet the cry for ventilators, masks and gloves is relentless. All of these are suddenly in short supply. All because of PANIC, hoarding and international health directives.” “Test kits started arriving and lock downs went into effect, one country after another. Doctors were panicking about being infected so followed international guidelines on INTUBATED ventilation instead of using masks or cannulas for oxygen. This is pretty much fatal for a pneumonia patient and ventilation is typically for someone with an inability to breathe mechanically, not for an issue with oxygen exchange in the lungs. Even in those without pneumonia, intubated ventilation can cause pneumonia and a loss of oxygen exchange, typically in 25%+ of cases. They even have a name for it - VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia). Pneumonia  Age  Pre-Existing Conditions = Bodies start stacking up.” April 9, 2020 \\\\\"The next step, as per the Canadian Guidelines, would be to intubate me causing VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia)*.\\\\\" (Based on direction from  the WHO). \\\\\"I would then drown as my lungs filled up due to the pressure induced VAP\\\\\" \\\\\"Four months ago, I would receive pain medication and oxygen (as needed) through a cannula (nasal tube). I would have x-rays and antibiotics and be back with my family in a day or less.\\\\\" May 7, 2020  “In the case of COVID 19 and ventilators, doctors who are supporting and condoning an active role in the clear misuse of ventilators are essentially killing their patients.” “From death by ventilator and a failure to use a known cheap treatment (Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin) to the lockdown induced deaths from heart attacks, diabetes, stroke, suicide and more, we are slowly suffocating while being \\'gas\\' lighted by the media daily.” Speaking of Hydroxychloroquine All articles published in 2020 here. And how do we know they knew they were killing COVID patients? The biggest voice for early ventilation in Alberta admitted it in April 2021 and still continued to put people on early ventilation. Note the Average age of COVID Deaths at the time this was written. 82 years old! \\\\\"Very early on in this, we realized that there was a strong age cutoff to COVID where you didn’t survive if you got put on a ventilator. The studies made it clear that if you’re over 80 on a vent, you would die.\\\\\"\"}\\n',\n",

Q1 in 2023, showed promising results. However the first month in Q2 (#April2023) - the economy has run out of steam and is tanking.China’s economy is viewed through the lens of numerous financial indicators including it’s imports and exports, and it’s manufacturing. The economy was surging pre-covid thanks to a property bubble, which has been burst now that debt facilities for large property development companies such as Evergrand have now been pulled and the property market and investment in properties has fallen off a cliff, and the appetite for consumers to buy properties has tanked.Imports fell by a whopping -7.9% in April indicating a drop in a drop in Chinese #manufacturing and domestic demand (it imports it’s raw materials from abroad). Exports dropped sharply from 48% in 2021 to 14.8% in March, and now down to just 8.5% in April 2023, an example is the drop in imports from South Korea, down by 25%. A fall in imports is a global concern, as this means China may not be able to service demand in the future. This will also mean a drop in GDP for China, who warns of a complicated period ahead as many of it’s export markets are facing a risk of recession.#Production output is in positive territory for April, the slowdown in imports is yet to materialise at factory level. However the 6.5% realised is around half of what they had projected at the start of the year - being 10.9%, in order to meet their predictions for GDP growth in 2023. The manufacturing sector, which employs about 18% of China’s workforce, remains under pressure due to slack global demand. Some exporters told Reuters at the country’s biggest trade fair they have frozen investments and some have cut labor costs in response.The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) declined to 49.2 from 51.9 in March, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, below the 50-point mark that separates expansion and contraction in activity on a monthly basis. The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, on Friday stressed that restoring and expanding demand is the key to a durable recovery. In reality, anti-Chinese product sentiment across the democratic and civilised world has lost it’s appetite for doing business with a dictatorship that has over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps, and has demonstrated a belligerent foreign policy attitude and raised armed conflict tensions with the West over it’s wrongful claim that Taiwan needs to be brought in under the CCP’s rule on the mainland. China’s support for Russia demonstrated by it supply of aid to Russia in it’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has created concern and disdain for the Chinese and Chinese products across the globe, and this looks to materialise in even less business being down with China over the coming decades.The property market has fallen off a cliff, it is done -16.2%, down from March’s -7.2%. This has happened since the CCP introduced legislation to prevent developers from becoming over-leveraged, a prime example being Evergrand which has accumulated over $300 Billion in #debt. Multiple crises since mid-2020 have included developers’ debt defaults and stalled construction of pre-sold housing projects. 25% of the Chinese economy is in the property market. A good measure of this market is in the amount of bank loans being provided to manufacturers and property buyers. It is down 82% from March!Please see my other thread highlighting the 160 Trillion Yuan local government debt pile that is equivalent to China’s annual GDP, maturing between now and 2027, which they can’t afford to pay for.Ps.

'We've only been here a few hours and have seen half a dozen people die while they wait for treatment.' - Sky News ground report from Delhi,,https://v.redd.it/dkjdc0upf2v61,2021-04-24 06:31:03,delhi
Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Edit. Join /r/atheismindia for more discussion on leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

"WhiteHatJr filed a 20 CRORE defamation case against me, Pradeep Poonia.","So WhiteHatJr Filed a 20 CRORE defamation lawsuit against me. 

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty. 

Thanks

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some requests:

1. PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

Thanks again

"Tomorrow morning is the hearing of my case, Karan Bajaj & WhiteHatJr VS. Pradeep Poonia.","So guys here we are. Most of you on this subreddit know how it all started.

In short, I tried to express my opinion against the malpractices of WhiteHatJr, they kept putting down my videos/posts/accounts. And then a lot of things happened and their scam was exposed. Then they filed a 20 crore defamation case over me for exposing them.

Updates since my last post:

* Thank you for all the amazing support you guys showed in my last post telling the news of the case. I asked if I go forward with the case, will you guys support me. And the response was amazing. I am not doing a fundraiser as of now, because the legal cost is not clear now. So let's wait for the hearing. Don't want to end up raising more than what's needed.
* Me and our lawyer, Swathi Sukumar worked really hard on the case. Let's see how it goes tomorrow. Last time they got the Former Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi to represent them. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
* After the case got listed on 23rd Nov, the High Court asked me to take down only 12 tweets and 4 videos which I did. But after that on 6th December my entire Twitter Handle (@ WhiteHatSnr, with 15.2K supporters) was suspended because of 'requests' from WhiteHatJr guys. So is Twitter above our judiciary? Isn't this obstriction to justice? WhiteHatJr had pointed issues in some of my tweets, how will I show those tweets now to show the context of those tweets?
* In the last week of December, even chats from our Telegram group (@ WhiteHatPoonia) were removed for copyright. Who would have thought if that was even possible? Billions of dollars worth of content from Netflix, Prime, Disney etc is being circulated over Telegram, no one can stop that. But WhiteHatJr and Byjus still managed to delete some of our chat.
* Karan Bajaj is still showing up in interviews, telling about their 'successful' company. Today there was news of WhiteHatJr on News18. By tomorrow there might be more paid news coverage.
* I request you guys to write about this issue.

On a different note, if someone is near Delhi, if possible, do visit the farmer's protest. Now I don't know a lot about the new laws, I was too much consumed in my own case. But I really feel that this should not turn violent and govt should listen to these people. On 2nd Jan, I went to Delhi to sign some legal papers and while returning I missed the last bus and found myself right next to the farmer's protest at the Tikri border. Spent the night with these guys, talked to many of them.

News isn't showing their actual points in my opinion.

Again thank you guys for all the support. Reddit is where it all started, keep up the support tomorrow (6th Jan 21). Really counting on you guys. WhiteHatJr crossed all the limits, fake ads, false claims, fake reviews, suppressing dissent, personal abuses, bullying, death threats, and then this 20 crore case. These people don't have any ethics in them. An entire generation was pushed in engineering and now it's the coding 150 crores salary dream.

Tomorrow morning, be there on Twitter, do comments under the Live Law tweets, and express your opinion about this scam. Let's make sure they don't get to influence news again with their marketing campaigns and 'incentives'.

Let's be the change we want to see.

Thank you,

Pradeep Poonia

UPDATE: The hearing is at 10:50 AM (6th Jan 2021)

\----------------

UPDATE (1 PM, 6th Jan) 

The defamation case filed by [**#WhiteHatJr**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=whitehatjr&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6752487782616236032) and [**Karan Bajaj**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABE6qAB7ldySvvRNyKUsnc8ykKy0aCFr30) against me was listed today before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. I had requested documents from ASCI and from National Consumer Helpline, where complaints against WhiteHatJr were filed.

I had also asked for the records of Wolf Gupta/Ryan Venkat ads from Facebook and Instagram, and the take-down info from Twitter and YouTube. These requests are called ""discovery"" in legal language.

The hearing couldn't go on because of some server issues in the high court, but WhiteHatJr is SO predictable.

They opposed my requests for these documents and don't want these documents to be produced before the Hon'ble Court. They must be scared of what might come out in the open if these documents are given to the court!!

The next hearing is on 1st Feb. I hope you guys will continue your support.

Let's keep up the roar.  
They can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but CAN NOT fool all of the people all of the time. 

Thank you for all the support.

"Remember that 14 y/o kid who wrote feeling guilty because of BYJUs EMIs, Byjus took down his profile from LinkedIn. And update for my tomorrow's hearing.","So that kids post got a lot of support on LinkedIn. (on 6th April)

At around 3 AM (7th April) I was reading someone's comment under that post and GONE. The post disappeared. I looked for the kid's profile and that was also gone.

Right in front of everyone, Byjus suppressed dissent. IS this BYJU's way of saying 'we don't care about your Freedom of Speech, we OWN entire media'.

I contacted the kid & talked to his mother, she almost cried over the phone sharing how Byjus people harassed her over her requests to cancel the EMI. The kid was really hopeful when his post got viral. But the next day (7th April) his post along with the account was taken down. And then BYJUs also deducted this month's EMI. Now imagine how would normal parents would raise their voice against this company?

There must be 1000s of middle-class and poor families right now trying to get their refunds from BYJUs. Left right up down, every media house is silent on this issue.

And then just a few hours ago on FB, I found this, someone with a new fake FB profile was trying to spread fake news, saying I called her and offered 50k to speak post against BYJUs.

[ Hope this doesnt comes under PI, as the account is totally fake with no connections. The likes are also most probably photoshopped because I didn't find any single post in this profile ](https://preview.redd.it/k4oo5w4psyr61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b79b0fcecd8bf7199cc427d54a8f735f73368d44)

Like I talked about this in comments here sometimes, Byjus will someday make me the bad guy with their media power. I hope you guys, the place where this whole moment picked up stick with me for some time.

Also, two days ago one more post got viral on LinkedIn and it was from a current Byjus employee only. He exposed the toxic and fraud culture of Byjus. And guess what? This post also disappeared the next day.

[This post is also gone now. ](https://preview.redd.it/74yb48r8kyr61.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d386bbcf54fe22ddd4bdf8eda8ad860ce93bdb)

And even after dozens of requests to Twitter India MD, Manish M., he didn't respond.In a way, these social media giants are treating us as second-class citizens. They don't care about our privacy, they don't care about our Freedom of Speech. If you ask for reasons for suspensions they don't respond and if you say I will go to court, they will say we don't come under Indian Jurisdiction. ""Wanna file a case on us, come to US first"".  Their software devs are mostly Indians, they make a good chunk of their revenue from Indian users, and most probably we Indians would be on top when it comes to the number of accounts on their platforms. And this is the level of freedom of speech they give to us.

I have created a new Twitter handle (pooniaV3). Kind of self-promotion but what else can be done. Unless our voices are not loud enough to shake their eardrums they won't care.

The hearing for my case is tomorrow morning, in Delhi High Court. I will be leaving for Delhi in few hours. If you support the cause let's meet on Twitter & make a change that matters.

We need to talk about 1984 Anti-Sikh Genocide,"36 years ago, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her bodyguards in Delhi on October 31. But what followed after was a state-sponsored genocide against innocent Sikhs. The sheer level of brutality that was exercised by the perpetrators, most of the whom belonged to the ruling Indian National Congress is something that cannot be described. Sikhs were burnt alive, our women were raped, Gurudwaras were destroyed and desecrated, hundreds became orphans that day. Congress workers were given money and booze for every murder they committed. That day, the Indian Government showed its true colours. Electoral Lists were also used to identify the victims and the Delhi Police openly let the pogroms happen. 

In total, more than 3000 Sikhs were killed (unofficial numbers are even higher) and the massacres happened not only in Delhi, but all across India.

However, there is something that isn't talked about. Majority of the perpetrators are still alive. They never got any time in prison. They are still roaming freely, you never know the man sitting across your table in a restaurant might have participated in the genocide. The Government even celebrated and awarded many of them. Leaders became MP's, MLA's and Rajiv Gandhi had the audacity to mock the victims when he openly tried to justify the genocide with his infamous "" when a big tree falls the earth shakes"".

People still don't know about how the judiciary was misused to provide protection to the perpetrators. We haven't received justice 36 years later. Sajjan Kumar going to jail after 34 years is a JOKE and he is just 1 guy. We don't deserve this, in fact, nobody deserves such mistreatment. People still don't know about the Ranganath Misra Commission appointed by the Congress which instead of providing justice to the victims completely exonerated (absolved) Congressmen from their brutal acts. The Commission outright rejected the majority of the affidavits filed by the victims as well as witnesses. It's no surprise for me that Mr. Misra later on became a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress.

36 years and no one wants to talk about us, not even the current Indian Government. People didn't support the Sikhs after the genocide. They voted the perpetrators back into the power and completely stereotyped my community, we became a bunch of 'drunk jokers' for the rest of the country, who would shamelessly be made fun of. Nobody talks about the victims, NOBODY.

We are all alone. Even in 2020, witnesses still receive threats and H.S Phoolka, a Sikh Lawyer who has fought for justice all alone still receives death threats. We don't see mass rallies in support of the victims, calls for justice and accountability of our Governments. My Grandpa was in Delhi that day for work. He was thankfully protected by the Hotel Manager, who kept him hidden for 2 days. My Grandma still remembers about how much she was crying because she didn't know whether he was alive or not. He ultimately survived and discreetly returned back to Punjab, 3 days later. 

The lack of humanity shown towards Genocide Victims in this country is absolutely appalling. We Sikhs haven't forgotten what happened to us but we need others to support us and to talk about the lack of justice. We can do this by educating people about the Genocide. Enough is enough !!

Lessons to learn by Indian women from Rhea Chakraborty's tragedy,"* Indian society hates women. It hates unmarried good-looking women even more. There is a reason why women like Draupadi, Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature. They are warnings meant to educate you. If you're in the wrong place, you will be punished, and everyone will love to watch you burn. Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture. It has always been this way and it will always be this way.
* Your biggest asset is your financial independence. This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have. Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children. Invest in yourself, invest in your future. Keep your finances separate from your partner. Do not trust anyone with your money. If your husband/boyfriend spends money on you, try to match it as much as you can. Do NOT accept free lunches.
* If your partner is paying for the house you live in, it is not your house. What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally. Unless you pay the rent (and keep the receipts) or have the lease in your name, it is not your house. It doesn’t matter if you have lived in it for 6 months or 10 years. It is not your house.
* The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family. Deeply patriarchal and broken. Don’t rely on the police, media, or any kind of state apparatus. You need to know that you’re vulnerable. Only money and power can protect you. Acquire those.
* Indian society doesn’t believe in love. It believes in transactions. Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on-screen but for them, it exists only on screen. It is entertainment. Be careful with who you love. Do not devote yourself to men who don't deserve it. Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man.
* What is considered fun for men, is considered debauchery for women. Indian society doesn't see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves. If he smokes weed, he is stressed and needs to let loose. If you drink alcohol, you are a characterless bad influence. Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust. If you can afford it, travel outside India to have fun.
* Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs. This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a man 5 years in your past, you don't need to give him 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime. Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
* If you have to live with dignity on your own terms, you have to fight. You have to fight everyone and everything. You will be crushed often. But it is a price worth paying.

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, this post seems to have struck a chord with all. By and large, the response has been positive, and it is very reassuring to me to know that there are many sensitive and empathetic Indians willing to change the toxic mindsets they have been raised with. Reddit also seems to be the last bastion relatively free of Sanghi trolls. Let’s try to keep it that way!

If I can make an appeal- PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy. It is a system so deep-rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize. Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin. You can start with her TED talk [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmvM1NOI1s) Before I met her, I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored/challenged etc. But after meeting her, I realized that patriarchy is a system meant to perpetuate itself and the only way to be free of it is to recognize it within yourself and STOP living your life according to the damaging ideas we have all unconsciously imbibed.

WhiteHatJr Lady Director is harassing me with false harassment allegations and Legal threats.,"After The Ken and Morning Context published their articles, WhiteHatJr and Byjus stopped putting down my videos. But they are still putting down videos of other people, in a much more aggressive and rampant manner. If your videos or posts go down, please let me know about them. I want to keep a track of every single content they are taking down.

So when they couldn't put down my videos, they restored to harassment. I started getting messages (from WhiteHatJr teachers, mutual contacts between me and WhiteHatJr) that I must back out before EOD else they will file a defamation case against me. This felt real and tbh intimidating to some extent.

Then from WhiteHatJr One Lady Director (let's call her WOLD) started giving me legal threats over LinkedIn. She claims I somehow harassed her. I took my elder brother's suggestion to not reply to her threats and kept doing what I was doing. So for 6 days, I didn't reply to her comments. But she just didn't stop, started calling me *'a coward', 'a\*\*', 'doesn't have guts'* for not replying to her comments.

I somehow stayed calm and didn't respond to her threats. She kept saying she would file a case over me for defamation and harassment, and that I will get a legal notice in a week's time.

Meanwhile, Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhitehatJr posted two articles on LinkedIn, in both, he tried to divert the topic and ignored all the questions and concerns that were raised. He basically used his daughter's example to point out that coding is a good tool to enhance learning (no one objected to coding as a part of the curriculum) and in the second one he gave the example of his mother, an army officer's wife, a total emotional route he took there. And somehow justified all the false advertisements of WhitehatJr.

There were some people on LinkedIn who were opposing WhiteHatJr and suddenly they started talking nice things about WhiteHatJr. This was alarming to me. I saw how they were trying to press the issue and move on. And on my posts, WOLD kept instigating me. She even made a new Twitter account to push me more, she kept saying she will file a complaint against me kept calling me a coward.

Finally, I confronted her over LinkedIn comments and told her that I am not scared of her false allegations. I said I am waiting for your legal notice, **TO THIS SHE SAID "" I am letting you go on Humanity grounds'.**

For an entire week she threatened me, bullied me over LinkedIn and Twitter, their teachers called me 'dog' (yes they did), their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments. But when I faced her she had no reply! IN FACT, she started tagging LinkedIn and Twitter telling them that I am bullying her by tagging her in comments.

This was too much for me to ignore. I collected all the snapshots of her threats, made an article on LinkedIn, documenting how she bullied me with her threats for an entire week. AND GUESS What happens next?

My article went down from LinkedIn within 8 hours! AND she disabled her LinkedIn account.

I reposted the article ALONG with the proof of how they suppress dissent, a snapshot of a post by WOLD on Workplace telling their 13k teachers to report my post. This is how they tackle dissent by attacking like a mob, putting baseless false allegations, threatening, and bullying, getting content removed like it's nothing.

Till now they haven't replied to a single question of mine.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ: Why am I doing this?

Won't go much into my personal life. In short:

* Kota Coaching life. I know what happens there. How aspirations are turned into a rat race. I have also seen Bansal Classes, the most formidable institute of its time going down. Whitehatjr and Byjus are nothing in front of that.
* IIT. Did it even though I never wanted to do engineering. I like other subjects more. Society makes people run after silly tags.
* Software job. I know no one gets a 150 crore salary, I also know coding cant be learned the way WhiteHatJr is trying to teach. Maths and coding cant be learned by spoon-feeding. Only intrinsic desire to learn it can make someone a good coder, not extrinsic rewards such a salary or tags. WhiteHatJr will just create a huge crowd of below-average coders who won't even be employable.
* EdTech Company experience: 8 months of exp (2017) in one such EdTech company showed me how ugly this sector is. There is no education and no tech, only sales and marketing. CEO of that company clearly said in a meeting ""we are not in the education business, we are in money-making business"". I left that company then.
* UPSC preps: I know what kind of depression follows after such failures. I missed Interview calls twice by a single digit, one time by 9 marks, and next time by 8 marks. I feel I have seen the darkest days and somehow came out of it. As an adult, I think I can comprehend how it would feel to a 13-year-old when his/her pipe dream of 150 crore salary (just like wolf Gupta) would break. Teenagers are most prone to depressions. WhiteHatJr can put an entire generation into life long depression.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS: Hey WhiteHatJr, I used WOLD and not her name because of the Reddit rules, not scared of you jerks.

"This is how Suniel Shetty saved the dignity of 128 Nepalese women 24 years ago, and stayed silent on his heroic act","On 5 February 1996, Mumbai Police conducted a raid at Kamathipura, Mumbai and rescued 456 survivors of sex trafficking between the ages of 14 and 30. Out of these 456, there were 128 Nepalese, and 50% were under 18 years of age.

But when Mumbai Police contacted Nepalese Govt, they refused to help them bring back to their country, because they had no birth certificates. It was an even worst situation for those 128 Nepalese girls.

Neither they can be in India, nor reach Nepal.

It was then that Suniel Shetty took the matters into his own hands. He booked tickets for all 128 Nepalese girls, made arrangements for their departure from India and ensured that they reach home safely.

And the biggest part.. He kept silent on his heroic deed for 24 years, since revealing this incident and the names would have jeopardized those girls' future.

This was recently revealed by Charimaya Tamang, one of the survivors of that raid 24 years ago. In an interview with Vice, she revealed for the first time how Suniel Shetty helped them, and saved their dignity.

Charimaya now runs an NGO which works against sex trafficking and the rehabilitation of the survivors and has won Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2013.

One act of kindness by Suniel Shetty, without any media hype and drama, changed the lives of those 128 women, and triggered a change and movement which will continue to help and support thousands of more women.

Big salute to Suneil Shetty, and his selfless act. Simple incredible!

TIL the only witness of the Salman Khan hit and run case died a more cruel death than the footpath victim,"After Salman ran over the homeless people, one died and the others were injured. During the incident, a constable Ravindra Patil who was appointed for protection was sitting beside Salman Khan in the car. Patil testified to court that Salman was drunk and was driving at high speed.

Post that it is said that Patil was mentally harassed by Salman's aides, the underworld and was also harassed by Mumbai police and his colleagues to change his statement. Further, Patil started skipping trials in this case. It is said that either Patil didn't show up to avoid harassment or he was kidnapped during the trials. He was dismissed from his job as well.

Finally court ordered to arrest Patil for skipping the trials. After being arrested and lodged in jail, police officials started treating him worse than the murder criminals. Once released from the prison, his family too disowned him.

He was homeless, became a beggar, his weight being reduced to 30 kilos and finally was admitted to the hospital suffering from TB. He succumbed to the disease ultimately. A 29 yr young constable suffered for 5 yrs and died a cruel death.

My uncle died this morning and I just want to vent.,"My uncle in his 60s, living in Lucknow, died this morning at around 6 AM. This was less than 48 hours after he developed a fever. He was already in a fragile state since he is post kidney transplant recipient. Transplant was several years ago, but he's still on some immunosuppressants. He started getting breathless within 18 hours of the fever. Initially my aunt tried to get him admitted in a hospital but there were no beds available. Some of my family members who are somewhat influential tried their luck but they couldn't get a bed in Lucknow and even in New Delhi. Finally it was also really difficult to arrange home oxygen for him, but we were able to source that. We couldn't make more efforts because the decline was so rapid that he expired today morning. Now crematoriums are also full. My family is in Mumbai and travelling is risky, my father doesn't want to miss his own brothers funeral but he is in a dilemma. Now another one of my relatives has tested positive. Parents are pretty stressed.
What I wanted to say is that the situation is so bad that you can die at home without medical care despite being severely sick. I feel frustrated with our government and our people, both who clearly knew how the situation today could be avoided. People not following precautions, government doing the same. It's like a person has set the rules but does not want to follow it on their own. It's such an Indian thing. I don't want this post to be political, and I think everyone who was flouting rules for COVID is equally responsible. I also really wish none of you have to go through this and lose someone close to you, because it's like anarchy out there and you won't even receive healthcare. I love all of you and I hope we all make it through unscathed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/mst7hw/my_uncle_died_this_morning_and_i_just_want_to_vent/,2021-04-17 15:52:17,delhi

It’s like 1 per every 4 person is positive. And the best thing forget the vaccine we can’t even get the testing kits for days I’m trying for weeks now still didn’t get it. And modiji is busy giving away vaccines to other countries. The youth is dying and he cares about his relationships. And why the phak they give permission to kumbh mela it’s 100% that kumbh mela will sky rocket the cases. But if they deny they will lose the votes so he gives more phak about votes than nation’s future.

DAE feel it's unfair how we're pushed to be extroverted leaders?,"I'm pretty introverted, soft spoken and have a stammer.
All the conferences, mentors and schools I've gone to have pushed me to be a ""leader"" which exclusively means being that guy at the front of the stage yelling speeches at everyone.
I get how that's appealing, I can't lie that I would love to be that kind of person, but that's just not who I am.
It's not in my personality.
But I feel like schools, colleges and especially workplaces reward and favor those who are more extroverted and leader-like.
It's like the extroverted leader is the only kind of person that goes up in this society.
In my opinion, a leader is just anyone who is willing to lead a group of people towards a goal, who serves them and pushes them forward. Yes, it requires speaking out and talking, but I dont think it exclusively means being the most extroverted and louded guy in the room.

"Please help, I ran away from home. Parents are trying to force me to marry someone who tried to rape me.","English is not my native language so please bare with me to be honest, I just join here to ask monetary assistance on a assistance group here. I am a Muslim girl, just turned 18 and I ran away from our home because my parents is forcing me to marry a guy a lot older than me, I guess he is around 45-50 years old. My parents is asking me to marry him cause my brother saw us in not a good situation and misinterpreted it, he was actually sexually  assaulting me. It is really important on our religion to stay pure until marriage and it is humiliating for them to saw me on that position. I try explaining them what actually happened but they are not listening and just forcing me to marry a disgusting old man. I run away home I just can't accept that I will marry a devil and it hurts me deeply that my family is not believing me.  I ran away home and currently staying at a friend but I can't be here forever. I ran out of money and still trying to look for a job, I cannoy reach out to any relatives because they will notify my parents  I will need to ask assistance to a group here on Reddit but it is not allowing me, asking me for a karma. I don't what that is and really don't know where to get them. I want to run away from my city as far as I can, but I need help from strangers, it is humiliating to ask for assistance there but that's my only way, I tried gofundme as Twitter suggests but it is not available on our country. Please please help me gain karma or tell me what karma on Reddit means. I want to get out of here as early as possible so that my parents will not catch me or if there is any other group that provides assistance without any karma. Thank you so in advance. 



Ps. I am really overwhelmed with all your support and warm messages, you've been all a great help and makes it less more depressing. I really apologize for not replying on your comments one by one, it's just that I am just connected to a convenient store WiFi and it's not stable, but I am reading everything and is trying to reply to you all good people. Just to add, I'm from the Philippines. I'm really scared to disclose this, I actually tried asking help on twitter and when I told them I'm a Filipina I was bombarded with a lot of guys trying to buy explicit pictures, because according to them, Philippines is land of cheap woman, but we are not. Please change this mindset. Again thank you and Im almost about to reach my karma goal. ♥️




PSS. thank you all so much. I'm literally crying I have saved everything, links, suggestions and I took screenshot of everything just a remembrance of how good people are. I really wanted to to thank all of you, one by one to show you how grateful I am but I don't know why for some reason it is no longer allowing me to send you a private message and to reply on your comments. I just really need 400 karma, just for me to be able to post on r/assistance but you give me a lot and I couldn't be more thankful and also to the badges and awards, I really don't know what that means and how to use it but still, thank you, I know that it is special here on Reddit. I have contacted DSWD and they said that they are willing to help but just needed to verify my background first, Im really scared because they might need to contact my parents. But yes, I will already be moving and will need to visit their office. I'm really sorry for dragging you all here, I'm really sorry especially to the ones that message me telling I'm a karma whore, I maybe am, I just needed those karma; I also decided not to post on any community as well including the ones I planned on asking donations and help, i don't know if I can handle any more hate on my private message and it's unfair, I see posts on those communities asking for help because themselves and loved ones who has terminal disease and such, they deserve the donation more than I am. I'm sorry that some of you can't believe my story and telling me hurtful things DMs sorry that I don't want to reply to you guys,  but please as much as possible let's be nice to one another, the world is hard on us already, let's not belittle someone's pain just because you are not experiencing it. 


I'm forever thankful to all of you. It's a great community and a proof that humanity still exists, I am looking on every option you guys provide. Sorry for being so dramatic, Im just really moved with all of your kindness. Thank you and may Allah and your God's bless you. ♥️




Last edit:  I still have mo words but thank you. Just an update, I still posted on a subreddit asking for assistance but it was removed since I need to be a user for 60 days, I cannot risk on waiting that long, I'm really sorry but is there any other group I can reach out for monetary funds?  I have found a shelter, and they advised me to keep the name on private, a fellow Filipino helped reached them thank you but we are still gathering funds for my transport money. They allow me to stay there and also allowed to hide my religion, I'm sorry but I don't want to practice Islam anymore, I still know that there is God but practicing it's rules is not for me. I wanted to freely express who I am. This might be the last edit I will do. I'm really thankful for all of your help.

My gf found her nudes on her stepdad phone *UPDATE*,"UPDATE!!!.... She told her mom before she got back from said foreign country and her mom advised her to remain normal until she got back the next day. Her mom also made her stay at her grandma's house and when she got back she confronted her stepdad. Initially the stepdad denied it over and over but when her mom said she has proof he admitted to doing it and gave silly excuses why like saying ""he wanted to protect my gf"". My gf mom proceeded to kick him out and told him not to come back. He after hearing that he tried to stab himself with a screwdriver but her mom threatened to call the police and he left. It's been 2 days since that happened and he has continuously tried to guilt my gf mom and accused her of cheating soo he dosent look bad. Her mom is understandably devastated and completely confused (this was her Significant Other/husband for over 10+ years) and she has since sought therapy for advice on how to proceed.

"Going homeless in a month, and here i am on Reddit. I heard the internet does wonders and that's what i'm hoping for.","First off let me start by saying i do not know what im typing, i do not know what im thinking, i have never felt like this before. Im not mad, not sad, not angry, not happy, ive never fult such nothingness before.

Anyways i have the rest of this month and the next month in my current home. After that im going homeless. All i have is a car and a few assets that can get a few bucks but not much to my name. I dont know if im allowed to talk about suicide but im going to be honest in my post; if the time comes and i havent found any hope or even a step 1, im going to kill myself. I dont want to die, but i dont want to live this life. I am not depressed or anxious or whatever, im good in the head, but recent events have taken their toll on me.

Forgot to mention thje important details, i am 19, just finished my first semester in Computer Science in university (and probably my last semester) and i do not work. I live in Lebanon. I do not have a passport to another country. I do not have anyone that can support me. I am completely alone and have a bit of money(1-2k ish) left if i sell my car and all i own.

&#x200B;

I guess the advice im asking for here is what should i do? Is there any hope? also please note i live in Lebanon; basically shit internet, shit electricity, no social benifits or whatever no nothing. This country is worse than a 3rd world. i probably miswed a lot of important details, but im struggling to think straight. Feel free to ask me anything (doesnt matter if its personal) related to the matter. Thank you for reading my reddit post. have a good day.

&#x200B;

Edit: I cannot begin to explain how i feel. I never thought anyone would care this much. I am not good with expressing myself but thank you to each and everyone who replied. It really is helping way more than you think. This is going to be a ramble but here goes. As to everyone asking me not to give up, i hope i dont. i want to figure this out and be on top i really do. i will try my best. i hope on day in the future i can come back and update you guys with a happy ending. i havent cried in a long time and you guys have brought emotions i thought were long gone. so thank you for that. I am trying to reply to every single reply but so many are coming in so fast, so for those that i miss, i am very sorry. Eventually i will get to it and i thank you in advance. So for those who are interested, i have concluded from all the replies a general plan that i would like to share for some criticism. First thing i should do is find a job, which i am trying my best to do. After i find a job i will try and find the cheapest/best rent i can and live on the bare minimum while saving up as much as i can. Now here is where i get a little lost. i know i should get a certain amount of money before considering immigration but have no idea what estimate that consist of, so help on that would be amazing. Next i will contact embassies (Canada and Sweden have been good suggestions so far) for help regarding immigration or a student visa. Also any help regarding immigration would be amazing as i have no clue how all that works. now that im typing that i feel like im asking for too much. i really dont deserve the support you guys have given me today, i cant thank you enough. Anyways that is the general plan, and i know for a fact once i land in a country better than Lebanon i will thrive. i know i can. All i need is a half decent government behind me that wont steal my money. thats it. i dont want rights, i dont want jack shit. i just want my hard earned money. So yeah this is probably the worst paragraph of words to read, so for those of you who did, thank you. My brain is barely functioning i feel like now, so this took a lot of energy to type. Thank you yet again to each and every single one of you. i mean it. I hope to update you guys soon on what happens.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I think i have finally replied to every single comment i got. If i get more replies during the night i will answer them tomorrow. I wanted to say thank you again everyone for everything you did. Also to everyone asking to donate, please go donate that money to a charity of your choice. I will be going to bed now, and i wanted to emphasize how much this all means to me. You guys changed me today. Thank you again. i cannot say that enough. I hope one day i will be posting an update with a happy ending. Thank you for your best wishes and hope to talk to you again soon reddit.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Hello everyone, i just woke up and got a shower and hopped on the computer. I am still in shock with everyone's support. i still cant thank you enough. I am reading through all the comments but i am afraid i do not have enough time to reply to all of them. I just want you guys to know i am reading your comments and i appreciate it way more than you think. Today is a big day for me; will be roaming around looking for jobs, need to setup some emergency foods and such. Lots to do today. Your support is giving me strength beyond what i thought i had. You guys have proven that people still care, there is hope. I will be updating you whenever i can, as i now consider you guys my friends. Also dont forget im reading your replies, and i really really appreciate it very much. Regarding looking for online jobs, i will try to make up a decent resume of sorts when i get back home and see what i can find. I really shouldn't be asking for more help from you guys, as you have done way more than enough, but i thought id ask ; i still have a few bucks remaining in my paypal, nothing worth cashing out though i was wondering if maybe like i can invest it or gamble it or of the sorts. Im obviously not counting on it, neither am i a gambler, just trying to give an example. Just a thing i can try my luck in see if it can help. Again, thank you to each and everyone one of you. i keep repeating myself but as i keep saying, im bad at expressing myself. I just want you guys to know i really appreciate everything. Will update you soon, have a good day everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hdzbna/going_homeless_in_a_month_and_here_i_am_on_reddit/,2020-06-22 19:45:26,agra
How do I mentally and socially recover from a false r*pe accusation?,"I'm in complete mental turmoil.

Long story short, I once had a nice, roughly 7 person very close friend group, one of us had a girlfriend and after they broke up she slept with me one night while we were both drunk at an afterparty (I apologized to the friend profusely for sleeping with his ex and we are on good terms now). Now she's moved on and is dating another one of my close friends, so yeah, she gets around the friend group quite well. Around a year ago, I noticed my friend (with the gf) start to get very distant from me, almost in a mean way. After a while I asked him why, he said his girlfriend didn't want him to talk to me (Understandable on both their parts, I am the guy that slept with his gf, and she likely didn't wanna see her one-night-stand too often) I took his word for it and moved on, okay.

I later start noticing many, many people in our more distant friend group/ network start blocking me on socials or being straight up awful to me if I reached out to them. I found out that she had told people that I had R\*ped her. Naturally I was very confused as I had NOT, and we'd actually been somewhat decent friends after we'd slept together (taken classes together and went to a few more parties and whatnot). I tried to reach out to her but she had blocked me, as had all of her close friends so getting through to her would be very hard. Her friends started attacking my friends (who had been there that night and know that nothing bad went down) and it tore my friend group apart.

Fast forward a year, and that original friendgroup is down to 3 (i'm fearing 2 soon enough) all my closer friends know I did nothing wrong but seemingly left as the drama was too much to deal with, and I understand that. The word seemingly keeps spreading and there seems to be no end in sight to the amount of harassments and hate i'll be getting, I have no idea what to do and I fear that things will only get worse from here as I slowly get ostracized from everything I had been a part of.

What do I do?

Edit: I've read through the whole thread, and will continue to do so as comments come in, thank you all for your help in trying to navigate this awful situation.

Edit 2: With the exception of the friend with the gf everyone that knows both of us and both sides of the story believes me, my behavior and personality isn't consistent with this accusation, and hers is",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mp9iig/how_do_i_mentally_and_socially_recover_from_a/,2021-04-12 08:23:55,tanda

I broke up with my transitioning parter and I'm getting hate from her friends and mine,"&ensp;It's not my intention to offend anyone if I use wrong terminology. This is a throwaway because friends know my account. Excuse any typos, I'm on mobile. I apologize for misgendering in the title, it won't let me edit it.

&ensp;I (m22) met Ex (22) a few years ago and we became good friends. When we met he was his assigned at birth gender(f). We started dating a couple of years ago, and things were going really well. Then about a month ago, he announced to family and friends that he was transgender and would like to be addressed by his new, male name and changed his look to something more masculine. He did not tell me he was doing this beforehand, apparently only his best friend since they were little(BF for short) knew this was happening. I was a bit shocked, but after some thought it made sense and I apologized for not recognizing his internal struggle sooner. 
&ensp;He was excited that everyone of his friends seemed to accept it, as well as family members, and I was happy to see him happier than I ever had before. He mentioned hormone therapy and surgery and how excited/nervous he was. It wasn't until about three days ago that anyone asked me how I felt as his partner, and I didn't say anything because I didn't want to take away from what I felt was his moment. I knew the conversation had to be had sooner than later. 
&ensp;I took Ex aside and said that I loved him and would be there for him, but if he went through with GR surgery it would be best to break up now. He was understandably upset and I didn't know how else to put it other than ""I'm not attracted to men."" He seemed to understand, but after I got off work I was met with dozens of messages from BF and a few of mine and his friends calling me a transphobe and doing this when he needed support. Some of my friends even suggested that if I loved him as a woman maybe I'd still be attracted to him as a man, but I don't want to string him along through his transition at the chance our love will overcome my sexual orientation. 
&ensp;I have no idea what to do about this and asking him to tell his friends to back off has been met with silence.

Edit: update in comments

UPDATE: Ex has finally responded to my messages and there has been some fallout with the friends who harrassed me. He only learned the full scope of what was going on last night because he had been ignoring messages while a couple of friends (who were not involved in the harrassing) spent the day cheering him up. He made them all apologize but a couple of his friends and BF added that they still don't like what I did, and I understand because I hurt their friend even if I meant well. I still don't think I'll be hanging around the ones who turned on me except for the one who apologized first because she had been told a slightly dramatized version of events (still not sure who had been telling people this version but at this point I just want to drop it.) Ex and I are going to take some time apart which is difficult but necessary to move on, and I hope we can stay friends when he's ready.

I've amassed a large sum of money and I'd like to use it for college. How do I convincingly lie to my family about how I got it? Should I even lie about it?,"18 year old high school senior here. This has been bothering me ever since I realized high school will be over in just a little over a semester.

Throughout high school, I've just been an average kid (on the surface). B student, doing the bare minimum expected of me, etc. Nothing astounding or terrible and I'm just trying to get through high school.

When I turned 16, I started working part time for my aunt at her restaurant just as a way to get some spending money for gas and going to high school football games with friends. She didn't pay me conventionally. I have a PayPal through which she would pay me. I was under 18 at the time so the account is in my mom's name, but she doesn't have the password nor any real reason (or so she thinks at least, she's probably forgotten about the account entirely at this point) to monitor it. Also, the account has my email and phone number. Point is, she has no access to the account. (This is probably relevant because it's what I used to acquire my money in the second half of this post.)

I made enough money for gas and the occasional ball game, but not much more than that. When I wanted to upgrade my computer, I began thinking of ways to make some extra cash. My aunt refused to give me a raise and my mom wouldn't let me look for a new job because she didn't want me to ""abandon my aunt"" for another business, why don't you just stop spending your money elsewhere, etc.

Drawing has always been a hobby and a passion of mine. I've been drawing since I was 9 or 10 and I'd say I'm pretty decent at it. So naturally, while brainstorming side-job ideas, I thought of starting an art commission business.

For the first few months, business wasn't booming. I had told all of my friends and family about it and posted it on my private social media. A few of my relatives commissioned art from me, but in hindsight it was almost certainly out of pity for my lack of business or maybe my mom told them to.

I eventually began posting about my art commissions on public media such as Instagram, Reddit (the account is long gone by now, don't ask.), and...the place where I struck gold...4chan.

The drought kept up for another month until someone replied to me on a /b/ art thread claiming to be interested in a commission. We exchanged Kiks and started talking. When he told me what he wanted me to draw, I found it repulsive and came up with an excuse, saying I don't have experience drawing what he wanted and thanking him for the offer. That was when he offered double the amount of money I initially asked for, offering me a whole 40 bucks.

$40 isn't a lot, but as I was younger, it was about equal to a day at work. So on the one hand, $40. On the other, I did not want to nor did I have any experience in drawing furry porn.

To summarize the next few days, much to my surprise, the guy liked my work and said his friends did too. He invited me to a Discord server full of people like him, and from there I joined other servers and forums and message boards dedicated to ""that kind of art."" From then on, the commissions started rolling in, first slowly, then steadily. Once both demand and my skill in drawing that kind of art increased, I started buffing up my prices.

Let me tell you. those sick bastards will pay a lot. a LOT. for those commissions. No shit, the highest commission I ever charged was for $350, and the dude paid it in full. The average price of a commission was around \~$75-100, with the price increasing for more demanding artwork, technically demanding or mentally demanding. (I didn't tell them about the mentally demanding part, I had to keep up a reputation by pretending to be one of them. Easily the worst part of the job.)

You may be wondering, why did I continue doing this after I got enough money for that computer upgrade? Well, I was 16-18 and making more money than my previous self could've ever imagined making. Of course I continued the commissions. Besides, after drawing your 50th naked anthropomorphic ""fursona"" (these guys' furry alter egos), you start to get pretty desensitized towards it.

After drawing your 150th, or your 200th, however, starts to become a little dehumanizing and mid-life crisis (early-life crisis?) inducing. I finally made the revelation earlier this year that I just can't do this forever. Not only would it probably not be a very secure job forever, but it made me progressively more disgusted by myself.

Aaaanyway, in the past few years, I've managed to rack up just under $22,000 in furry art commissions. I'm ready to forget about my past, go to art school, study graphic design, and make a living as an artist in a legitimate way rather than a repugnant way.

My parents aren't rich, but they are just a little on the wealthy side. They and I have discussed the expenses of college in the past and they have told me that if I were to continue living at home, attend a certain art school which is relatively close to home (and is relatively inexpensive), and get as much financial aide and scholarships as I could, they would be able to cover most of the expenses, but I would probably need a loan of $25,000-30,000 to cover the rest. Assuming I can get accepted into the college (which I think I easily can), with my savings and their savings, and a little bit of being economic, I believe I would be able to attend all 4 years without having to get a loan at all. My main idea was to tell them I won the lottery, but...I don't know. I hate lying and I've been hiding this from them for years. I feel like i just need to come clean with them about it. I have absolutely no idea how they would react.

All that to ask this. What is the best way to go about this? Should I go through with lying to them? What would be the most believable way to lie to them while keeping their trust and support?

TL;DR: Made bank drawing furry porn in high school. Parents don't know about the money but I want to use it for college. What do?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Currently, my favorite idea is the middle ground of telling them about how I got the money from my commissions while also not going into the detail of my art. I would play it off as if it was a surprise and that's why I didn't tell them earlier. Another idea I like is investing it and getting a loan. Maybe I'll do one or both of these, or perhaps neither. I haven't fully decided yet.

To those who wish to see my art (furry or otherwise), and to those who say they wish to commission art from me, I'm going to have to regretfully decline your request. I've said too much here, to show my art or give my contact information for a commission would possibly be too identifying. For the same reason, I don't want to reveal the servers or forums I was formerly active on. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just want to be careful. Sorry about that. If you're looking to get into the furry art industry, 4chan art request threads may be your gateway if you're persistent and eventually get lucky.

EDIT 2: Don't worry guys, I will talk to an accountant and pay my taxes. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. That will be my first priority once I talk to my parents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dojem5/ive_amassed_a_large_sum_of_money_and_id_like_to/,2019-10-29 02:09:08,agra

Brother is constantly screaming at the Xbox all night parents are both deaf (I am M 15 he is M15),"So my twin brother plays xbox all night (including school nights even through we haven’t had any in a little bit) and he just screams at the it. He literally doesn’t stop, when I tell him to stop I am trying to sleep he threatens me with a hockey stick and tells me to stop being a bitch. 

I’ve had 7 hours of sleep in days since he doesn’t stop screaming, I am not allowed to take his controller since we have 2 of them. It’s constant and he literally burst into tears at times for losing a game of madden, I recently just woke up from one of his screaming fits that has lasted about 45 mins so far. 

He doesn’t stop nor does he care about others. He’s been admitted to the insane asylum once for putting a knife to his throat when my mom took his phone after he wouldn’t clean his room. He put a knife to his throat since he wouldn’t clean his room, and they released him the same night. He’s just not ok in a good mental state. When his best friend wrote him a 10 paragraph wall of text and he judged responded with “ok idc”. 

He hasn’t always been like this and he has had huge personality changes which have scared tf out of me. My biological father keeps telling me it isn’t a big deal since he’s normal. Clearly he isn’t normal. It should also be noted he best my knee into a swollen mess when I took his bike down the street I buy me and him ice cream, he told me I never got permission to use his bike. 

The things I’ve done to him have all been in self defense and I get in trouble most of the time. He told the driver of the Ambulance that I told him to do it and I am always trying to make him fail in life.

I think my mom and brother are having sex,"I’m sort of at a loss with this. To start off, I’m 25 and my brother is 20. Our dad passed away a year ago and my brother had a really hard time with it. He eventually withdrew from college and moved back home to get his head straightened out. I was home visiting this weekend and everything seemed normal. We hung out, went out to lunch, my brother and I saw a movie together, we caught up, the usual family stuff. My mom converted my old bedroom into a home office, so I was sleeping in the guest room in the basement.

Last night, after everyone went to bed, I snuck out back and blazed up. Don’t judge me. I’m not a pothead, but it helps me to relax sometimes. I came inside, watched tv, and around midnight was stupidly hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack.

While I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard someone yell something upstairs but it was muffled. I went to the base of the stairs and listened and I heard was I’m positive were sex noises from upstairs. I didn’t think my mom or bro was seeing anyone and I definitely didn’t thin anyone came to the house after I went downstairs. I was mostly just curious so I crept up the stairs a little and I could hear one of the voices was my mom for sure. I assumed it was just a booty call and maybe someone snuck in while I was downstairs. I went back to the kitchen, warmed up some pizza in the toaster oven and was eating it at the counter when I heard a door open and close upstairs, followed by footsteps, and then another door closing. Again, curious, so I went upstairs and went to my bro’s room to see if he was awake and knew what was going on. His light was on so I knocked lightly and he answered the door in boxers and looking sweaty. He sort of jumped when he saw it was me, like he wasn’t expecting it. He asked what’s up and I said I thought I heard some noises up here and wondered if he had too. He got super sketchy and blushed and said he hadn’t heard anything. I was super suspicious now and also felt super awkward bc it sorta seemed like maybe he had been involved in making those noises. I felt really embarrassed and weird and I basically gtfo of there and went downstairs.

I couldn’t sleep that night and today at breakfast things were way awkward with me and him and mom. Maybe I’m being paranoid, I was smoking last night, but it feels like maybe they’re having sex and I caught them. I don’t know if I’m crazy and there’s another explanation or if I should say something. Part of me thinks if they are doing it they’re both adults, but idk, it’s got a major squick factor to it and I’m sorta at a loss. Do folks think I’m just being paranoid and, if not, should I say something?

Edit: I should have mentioned that I’m a female. Dunno that it makes a huge difference but Some people assumed I was a guy.

[UPDATE]


Still figuring out what comes next, but I got so much advice and so many responses last time I wanted to update you all. Last night, I pretended that I was going out for dinner and drinks with friends and said I wouldn’t be home until late. I drove around the block, parked, and snuck back into the basement. And then I waited and listened.

I heard the tv on and my mom and bro talking. I couldn’t really make out what they were saying. Around 9 o’clock they went upstairs. Once I was sure they were both upstairs I snuck up and listened at the base of the stairs (around the corner from the bottom so no one would see me). I felt like a nut but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about all the what ifs. I heard voices from my mom’s room; again too soft to make out. After maybe 20 mins I heard a moan. I crept up the stairs and when I was at the top I could hear what were distinctly sex noises from moms room.

I crept down the hall to see if my bro was in his room, pushed the door open, and stuck my head in. At this point, I didn’t care if he asked me what I was doing home, I figured if he was in there I’d just tell him I came home early and wanted to hang out or something. But it didn’t really matter. It was empty.

I went back down the hall and listened at mom’s door. It was mostly quiet, the sound of the bed, a few grunts, but I distinctly heard mom saying oh fuck a few times. After a few minutes they clearly had climaxed, somewhat loudly, and the noises stopped and I heard my brother’s voice. He said he was going to take a quick shower. Then mom said she’d join him.

I was and am in a daze. I don’t think there’s any doubt that they are having sex. I went back to the basement and I’ve been lying here thinking for the last few hours. I haven’t said anything to either of them. Part of me wants to burst in on them, part of me wants to confront my bro, I don’t really want to talk to my mom.

It’s a really weird position to be in. I’m still sorting through all the thoughts I have. It’s a lot of different feelings all at once. It’s hard to explain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fc4nv7/i_think_my_mom_and_brother_are_having_sex/,2020-03-02 01:52:24,ooty
I (22/M) was forced to have “the talk” with my sister (8) and witnessed firsthand the dangers of unrestricted Internet.,"8-year-old sister had asked me whether she was born was because of sex. I honestly answered “yes” because I knew she would find out sooner or later. Also, I don’t have the heart to lie to her. Although I did not delve into the lovemaking details usually reserved for Sex Ed (penis goes into vagina, sperm fertilizes egg, etc), the way she phrased her question was one where you cannot fool her into thinking she was transported by UPS storks.

I was slightly relieved she didn’t press on for what I was taught in Sex Ed, but she has absorbed how pregnancy works, one by a tell-tale sign of missing a period (which she has not completely learned yet). She had gained this knowledge by subscribing to a YouTuber who talked about her pregnancy experience (I’m guessing in vlogs and AMA form).

Having her own phone, she started to do something I only remembered doing first at 15 on my desktop: googling XXX on purpose. I thought she would be searching for the movie XXX: Xander Cage or the late rapper XXXTentacion (autofill gives his profile), she actually typed in XXX as in intent to enter a pornsite. She had clicked on images and had screenfuls of naked sex, with cum dripping out in some, faces of orgasm and pain in others and period sex in one image. Her curiosity ended up in me explaining to her that the cum is “discharge” (which she didn’t probe further into) and that sex is painful, comparing it to the most painful vaccination she remembered. She listened in awe, and I was asked if I had done it before with my SO. No, sis. (context: SO didn’t consent, wanted to keep the V-card until marriage. But watched porn regularly and had friends who slept around)

Since I had gone this far down the rabbit hole, I warned her that sex is by mutual consent ONLY, and she cannot do it until she is grown up (I regret not telling her both partners must be 18), and she must refuse any sexual encounters or I will personally hunt the predator down. I repeatedly emphasized that underage and/or non-consensual sex will get her and/or her partner thrown in jail.

The previous paragraph, yes, were big words for an 8-year-old, so I analogized it to a game of NERF (since she is a NERF enthusiast, and I have a NERF gun at home) - “you must get your friend’s permission, and both you and them must be OK with playing NERF together. If your friend says no, and you shoot them anyway, you’re a bully and will get into trouble. Because your friend already said no.”

Now, she remembers having the talk as the ""NERF talk"". I’m quite shaken by this. I never had “the talk” at home growing up, and I only had Sex Ed, biology, porn, and my friends’ sexual experiences to formulate this. I am concerned with how much exposure she has when she is not with me or my folks. Should I let my dad know about the talk? Is it rude for me to tap her phone (personal property) and tighten Internet control? How do I approach this? Any advice is appreciated.

Also, if this is more appropriate for an asking parent forum do let me know. Thank you.

**EDIT 1:** I have truly messed up by saying that sex is painful. Thank you for pointing it out. I was speaking about it from second hand accounts from my friends, who concur about the painful part. The orgasm/moaning faces that my sister saw appeared to be a look of pain to her (like a ear pull) so I had wrongly concluded. If she brings it up again I will correct myself.

**EDIT 2:** To those who are @-ing me for giving her wrong info - I get it. I'm living in a household where ""the talk"" is straight up taboo. We all waited until middle school to have it, and it was conducted by our school. I have no choice but to step up.

**EDIT 3:** Age of consent where I live is 16. Though the law views sexual relations from 16 to 18 as dependent on the relationship. If the offender was exploitative (i.e. a person of authority such as a teacher, coach, doctor) they will be charged.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gsacdr/i_22m_was_forced_to_have_the_talk_with_my_sister/,2020-05-28 17:15:46,agra
How do I tell my employee I found their OnlyFans?,"I am an accountant at a fairly large & well known insurance agency.

I was on my Instagram earlier today when I saw one of my employees suggested as a person to follow, this was odd since we already follow each other.

Turns out this is my employees secondary account where she advertises her OnlyFans and ""Other Services""

I stopped lurking on her profile as soon as the surprise wore off.

I cannot stress enough how great of an employee she is. I have no complaints only praise. Not only is she a great employee I genuinely  see her as one of the best people I know.

I understand this is 100% her business. What she does on her own time with her body is none of my concern. I will not share or discuss this with anyone inside work or out.

The problem lays in the fact that I am not her only direct supervisor, and her profiles clearly show her face. My colleague is pretty uptight, religious, and generally disapproving. I worry that if she showed up as a suggestion on my Instagram she might to others and somehow get into the hands of my colleague who I am sure would use this to get her fired either directly for this or some other reason.

I don't want to lose a hardworking employee over something that is no ones bushiness but hers. I would like to suggest to her that maybe she might want to crop or hider her face out of unpaid content. How do I talk to her about this? Do I?

I won a $5000 POST-election bet that Trump would NOT be president today and I need advice on collecting my payout from inside buckets of concrete!,"So I bet a guy from work (3 weeks after the election!!) $5000 that  Biden would be President on inauguration day. He was drinking the kool aid hard reading all sorts of crazy shit 1000% convinced Trump would remain in office. He'd send me Tik Tok videos as proof every day of random ass  people explaining how it was going to happen. Seeing how relentless he  was I said why don't you put your money where your mouth is. Soon enough  a $500 bet quickly escalated into a legit $5000 bet after lots of  ridiculous back and forth.

So here we are, I won, and you're not gonna believe it but the Trump guy is being a sore loser!! He is 100% going to pay me but he is  trying to win the only way he can - by making it a pain in the ass for me to get my money so he can have a laugh.

He has ordered 75 small aluminum pill containers ([see here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C14SXSM/)) and has about 15 home depot buckets ([see here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613)) which he intends to fill with  concrete. As of now his plan appears to be to put hundred dollar bills  (50) scattered throughout the pill containers and buckets of concrete. Rebar or wire mesh may be used. He included me in a giant work group message where he is grandstanding  his plans ([see here](https://imgur.com/a/6rOaOKj)) - that's how I know all this. Once again this  is the only way a guy who just lost $5000 can ""win"" - right  out of the Trump playbook!

At this point his intention is to make me work as much as possible for the money for a laugh. He  certainly will put more thought into making this a pain in the ass for  me than he did making the bet in the first place.

My goal at this point is to give him as little satisfaction as possible or even flip this in my favor and completely take the wind out of his sails. Since he revealed the pill containers he ordered, as a preemptive strike plan, I went ahead myself and ordered 75 of them as well.  They'll be here Friday along with a stack of fake hundreds from Amazon. Here's a couple  scenarios:

1. He does not put the money in any of the pill containers in an  effort to simply hand me the money after I crack through all the  concrete just to have a laugh at me. IF he does this - I could open 2-3  buckets to get a gauge for what's in the buckets/containers. If it  appears the are empty I present to him my own 75 pill containers that I  easily covered with my own concrete mix and he would thus unknowingly  foil his own plan. At this point I'd feel him out for info and see if he  turns over money then. I'd pretend he got me good (video and all) then I  could then drop the full concrete buckets in his truck and send him a  video revealing I have outsmarted him. This is best case scenario.
2. He fills 50 of the 75 pill containers which would make sense for 50 $100 bills and 75 total pill bottles. In this case I'd have no choice  but to go through them all. This would be his best move guaranteeing I  go through them all. In this case my only winning move would be to dump  the 75 containers that I ordered (with concrete on them) in his truck at  work the next day to make it seem like it only took me one day to get  the money. Then later just chip away at the buckets myself.
3. I have to crack open all the buckets but then fill my own buckets with pill containers and concrete and give them back to him. The ol' bait and switch. I can also preemptively do this - so almost on the same day or next day I give them back to him so he thinks they are the same buckets he gave me and develop a story around that. Photoshopping pictures is an option as well.

Help me out Reddit! I either need a good counter plan or some good advice on getting these containers out of the concrete! A hammer drill? Could I drop them from the top of a bridge? Or find someone with an old fire department ladder truck and rent it for an hour to drop them from the top?

**Current payback plan:** u/[amasterblaster](https://www.reddit.com/user/amasterblaster/) has a brilliant idea. Take the fake buckets to his house. Offer a $2000 settlement if he takes them back. If he says no leave the buckets. If he says yes go directly to ATM get $2000 from him. Let him crack open all the staged buckets - then when he comes looking for his 2 grand back I give it back to him in concrete!! Or I plant the 2 grand in the buckets so he realizes theres money there but comes up $3000 short and realizes his folly.

**Current concrete busting plans:** Sledgehammer for potential simplicity, dexpan a non explosive expanding agent for concrete, rotary hammer, or a simple excavator to smash the shit out of the blocks.

**Few responses to comments:** I'm not suing him. I'm not turning him into authorities for ruining money - its not getting ruined. He 100% IS paying the money. I've known him a long time this isn't a random person. He's just busting my balls.

P.S. I couldn't in good faith take the money knowing some people died because of this conspiracy theory so I am donating a portion of the  winnings to the deceased Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick's family.

I really feel like I want to remove Facebook and never use it again. Should I just go for it?,"1. I use it mostly for the chat I have with my wife, which we can switch with something like Telegram. 
2. Every time I post something serious, like, scientific or interesting (For me) little to no one likes my posts - and absolutely 0 people engage in a meaningful conversation via comments. The most I had regarding this were joke comments. 
3. On the contrary, every time I post something funny, I get 10 to 20 reactions. Which is neat but I always think about the 0 engagement I receive from serious posts. 
4. I feel like I don't want - ever - to argue about anything with anyone, because its pointless. After YEARS over the internet, there is no way in hell that a discussion can be constructive. It's more like 99% of the people end non changing any of their ideas at best, while insulting each other at worst. The 1% of it is good exchange but it's something so rare that ... title . 

I get it that it might be seen as childish thoughts (likes and engagement) but I really feel like I should get out of it and never think about it again. 

I'm keeping instagram because it's way less about talking and more about showing stuff that I might be interested in. Also, there's way less boomers. But I'm thinking about removing it too.

"As a female police officer, is it inappropriate for me to post a bikini picture on social media?","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Per the title post, I am a female LEO. Last week I had posted a picture (Facebook and Instagram) of me out by my neighborhood pool in a bikini. I should mention, this is not a thong bikini, or one that is too small for my figure. It is literally a bikini I bought from Kroger. A very normal, not seductive, average bikini. No cleavage or booty shown in the picture. 

When I first started out at my department, I was uncomfortable adding ANYONE from my workplace to Facebook. But, I kept getting more and more requests from colleagues. I thought, ""why not, I really dont have anything to hide. I dont post anything political or sensitive. I have no pictures of me that should or would ruin my career"" It shouldnt be a problem adding them back, right? WRONG.

Today, I was approached by a male officer in my department (that is non existent in the social media world). His exact words ""you need to be really careful about what you post on social media. Someone showed me a picture you posted... and that kinda stuff can get you fired"". 

I looked at him like a deer in headlights... like are you f***ing serious dude? How is this any different than my Male colleagues posting their shirtless gym flexing selfies? 

What irritated me beyond belief, is the fact that the officer that confronted me about this isnt on social media, so one of my other (most likely Male) collegues that I am friends with on Facebook, showed him this picture. 

Sure, I am in a career where my professionalism is important on and off duty and I respect that. But am I being held to a different standard here because im a female? Or am I in the wrong? I am always open for a nice discussion so please give me your thoughts

EDIT: I didn't think I would get this many responses. Although it's not feasible for me to reply to each person, I'm going through trying to read each response. I've gotten great feedback so far, thank you guys.

EDIT: My profile is set on private, for those asking. Also, I did know about limiting who can see certain posts I make, I just didnt think my picture was going to cause such an issue. I DIDNT know about the option of grouping my colleagues together on Facebook, so thank you to whomever recommended that.

EDIT: I think the best option at this point is to delete all colleagues from social media. I know not all of them may have negative intentions, but I deserve to have a life outside of work, and not worry that my coworkers are scrutinizing everything I do.

Some helpful people suggested I contact my local version of the Big Brother program, and they were happy to help me out getting everything official and less sketchy, although they needed her guardian's permission first. On my part I needed to get a background check from the police.

I sat down with her and explained what I was planning, and she seemed excited. I was a bit worried about what would happen when I asked to contact her parents as previous attempts had not been successful, but she gave me their phone number, and we got to chatting about the fun things we could do outside of just playing tennis.

I gave her mother a call the next day and explained who I was, how I knew her daughter and why I thought it would be a good idea for me to become her Big Brother. Her mother seemed very weirded out, understandably, but over all pretty nice. We agreed that I would drive her home the next time we played tennis so we could meet in person.

The day came and after kicking her ass (my forehand is mint boi), we hopped in the car and headed to her place. Her mother was just as I imagined from speaking on the phone, a completely normal human being. Her father however was a different story. If I say he was creepy it implies something sexual, but I don't mean creepy in that way. He had almost no emotions, he smiled when he first saw me, but it was not a normal smile. If I said something funny and he would laugh, but it was like a robot might laugh. Very fucking bizarre dude, just something off about him. Overall though I thought our meeting went well, they just asked that I wait until I got my background check before I did anything other than play tennis with her which is super reasonable and I'm actually glad they weren't willing to sign their kid up to some strange dude without it.

I went home and was super happy with how everything went. I was a tad worried her house was going to be some shit-hole and her parents were going to be druggies, but my fears were thankfully unfounded. A few days went past, and I was chillin', when I got a knock on the door. I open it and 3 cops are standing there looking too happy to see me. They ask me to come down to the station for an interview about the girl, although they tell me I'm not being arrested and it is voluntary. I may come across as naive in my last post, but even I can see that I need a fucking lawyer, so I tell them I'll meet with them when the time suits me.

After frantically Googling around for a lawyer, I find one who seems to be competent. He rings the police station and asks what they want to interview me about, but they are tight-lipped and only let on that it's about me hanging out with the kid. I speak to my lawyer for a bit and despite his hesitation, I agree to meet with the police and try and explain whats going on. I bring with me as much evidence as I can, my call logs to child services (surprisingly difficult to request that where I live annoyingly), my correspondences with the Big Brother people, I even printed off my Reddit post. Anything to make me look like the upstanding person I am.

The interview was nice, when I started laying out evidence of my good-intent they were surprisingly accepting of it. The fact that I had made multiple calls to child services went a long way to convincing them I meant no harm. There were a couple of things that irked me though, and I don't know if they will ever stop irking me. I overheard the police multiple times say ""he's not the guy"". The way they said it implied they were still looking for someone after me. The next thing that irked me was one of the officers told me that the reason he didn't think it was me was because ""when she texted you and said her boobs were sore, you didn't engage."" I've read through our text messages 3 times now looking for anything vaguely similar to that sentiment and I'm coming up with zip. I mean, I know nothing would turn up because I have never talked to a kid about their boobs in my life, but still I've triple checked.

I've thought it over and over in my mind, and the only conclusion I can make is that I was not the only man she was interacting with. I can't think of anything else. Why else would the police imply they'll keep looking for someone after clearing me? And then to bring up a conversation that never happened? He must've confused my convos with someone else's. At least if she has been interacting with other people in inappropriate ways the police are involved and they can catch the guy, but sure as shit I'm not speaking to her ever again.

Thank you to everyone for their advice, it definitely was inappropriate of me to be hanging out with her alone and I'm glad you guys told me so. My background check came in the mail today and so I think I will still go ahead with signing up with the Big Brother program, but it will be with a random kid and more importantly with their parents permission.

Edit: My lawyer was with me for the police interview, he just thought it was a bad idea. What does he know though, pfft I've seen Better Call Saul Season 1, I know all about the law.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cqqchj/update_im20_accidentally_befriended_a_12_year_old/,2019-08-15 14:11:02,tanda
Am I a bad person for wanting to be a police officer?,"I'm 20, mid college, gay, and have wanted to be a cop ever since I was little. 

I've done everything to prepare myself for a career in law enforcement. I've always wanted to help people. My motivations to become a cop are to help people. I've befriended the people of the department I want to work for, they all seem to be such nice and caring people.

I've always held the view that just like there are bad people in every profession, there are bad people in the policing profession. However over the past couple of weeks... I can't get the videos of so many cops doing so many horrible things to people who are being peaceful. None of it makes any sense to me. That's not what I know their training to be. 

I want to help people. I'm white and male, but I know how discrimination feels because of my sexuality. I don't want people to hate me because I wear a badge. I just want to help people and keep them safe. What should I do? It's like my entire life leading up to this has become shattered.

Edit: 
I'm replying as much as I can, it's a tad bit overwhelming.

I've gotten many 'go for it', many 'yeah, fuck you', many 'you'll be better doing something else', and I even got one guy who just called me bald because... reasons?

I appreciate all of you who are replying and giving me advice. Suffice to say, there's a lot of conflicting advice. 

For those wondering, yes, I do have a backup plan incase this turns out to be something I don't want to do. In fact, I have a few.

For those of you PMing me things, keep it on here. For those of you calling me some kind of white knight... no dude, I'm just a guy trying to be a good guy and learn from other people. Chill.

Edit 2:

I've answered as many comments as I can, and need a bit of sleep. I'll continue to answer several a day, with a goal of replying to everyone, even if it's just to thank them for their time

I hope you all have a lovely rest of your day/night/whichever, and again I wanted to thank everyone for your time and replying to my post.

I have much to think about and consider, thank you all for giving me the tools to do so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gwc00e/am_i_a_bad_person_for_wanting_to_be_a_police/,2020-06-04 06:37:29,goa
All hell is breaking loose again in terror attacks and I might be murdered and I am too scared of leaving my house again,"Hi, I am from Israel. I have bad OCD. 

There have been so goddamn many rockets and terror attacks in the last few days, including rockets that killed  a few civillians and a whole bunch of fighting, riots, anger and hate. Fires been lit up and specifically civillian areas are targets now for rockets. Even jerusalem was bombed and went up in flames in several hot spots.

I am so fucking terrified of being lynched and murdered. I dont want to leave my house but I have a final soon and Ill have to eventually. I go to a religious school so I wear religious identifying clothes and so I could be a target. Last time shit got this bad buses were exploding, month long terror waves of daily murder were going on, where even my brothers friend was murdered brutally in the street and just by chance a massive mass shotting was halted that would have been the end of hundreds of lives. I dont wanna die i dont wanna die i dont wanna die because of some shit politics.

And my fucking school people say that by continueing to function normally they rebel so they honor being killed this way as a fucking sacrifice. I dont want to sacrifice myself because my goverment is shitty.

Fucking help, Im going crazy, i dont want to be killed. And the worst part is sometimes the terror attacks are carried out in school shootings and my school also doesnt have proper bomb shelters. 


Help, please. I dont know what to do. I dont want to be here. Theres nothing I can do. 

My room is a bomb shelter and I havent left it in a couple days. Im too scared of leaving. My OCD was always danger related and I have locking compulsions, and finally I started working toward fixing it and now this shit happens. Ive relapsed and locked my house on 3 locks one metal extra door and in my bomb shelter room and I want to leave but I am terrified.
What should I do???

Girlfriend doesn’t want me to take dream internship,"I am 19 and my girlfriend of 2 years is trying to stop me from taking a 7 week dream internship that’s about 8 hours away from where we live. She’s threatening to throw away our entire relationship if I go. I feel like this could be a huge stepping stone towards my career after college and I really want to do it. To be fair I will have no electricity or cell phone service as I’ll be working at a wildlife sanctuary in the middle of nowhere, so it’s fair to be upset about limited contact. I’ve already accepted the offer and I leave next week but she tells me to just not go. What do I do? I love her so much but I’m really passionate about the field I want to go into.

Update: Just got home from work and was so happy to see all the overwhelming support from you guys! I’m definitely just going to go and keep pursuing my goals, if that ends the relationship, so be it. Once again, thank you to everyone who replied!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o7mb9n/girlfriend_doesnt_want_me_to_take_dream_internship/,2021-06-25 12:02:40,goa
I had to block my special needs cousin today.,"TLDR: my cousin cyber stalked my female cousin, sister, and my sisters boyfriend. Tried to use me as a pawn to get to them. Crashed my baby shower knowing the would be there. And a whole mess of drama in between!

Hey all! Honestly, I feel like a huge asshole today. I am totally prepared to hear it, but I just need to hear a new perspective on the situation. This post will be pretty long because there is 4 years of history here. I apologize for any grammar mistakes ahead of time, I’m 8 months pregnant and am totally scatterbrained! Also apologizing in advance if the formatting is weird, I’m on mobile!




So I have a special needs cousin who is a few years younger than me. Let’s call him Randy. We aren’t blood related, he is my moms step brothers son. But we spent a good amount of time together growing up, and never saw him as less of a family member. My family moved out of state when I was 11, and that created some drama within our extended family. So I really haven’t spent much time with him face to face since we were kids.


His parents like taking turns between ignoring he has problems, and thinking his problems are way worse than they are. Which always frustrated me, because he never seemed to get the care he needed growing up. Considering that, he is pretty high functioning. He graduated high school, he worked at Walmart for a few years, and is now working at a high school cafeteria. He’s really good at video games and played guitar in a band. He seemed to be doing well after high school.


But several years ago his social crew probably fell apart, like most do after high school. And all he did was sit on his computer on social media for hours a day. Trying to connect and feel social with anyone. His parents didn’t do anything to enrich his life. They have always had marriage problems and always let those problems take priority over Randy. I truly believe he was neglected for most of his life, and especially his adult life. And that breaks my heart for him. I was probably one of the only people that talked to him on a semi consistent basis.


Fast forward to 2017. I’m getting married. Our family drama has been squashed and this is the first wedding of the generation for the family. I’m not one for big weddings, so we found a nice chapel in Vegas and had a fun reception dinner. Luckily we all live in the Southwest so everyone was able to attend, including Randy and his family. It was honestly a great time! 


But this is when Randy reconnected with another cousin of ours. Let’s call her Tara. Tara is closer to Randys age, and they definitely spent more time together growing up.


Anyway, our honeymoon is when things started to escalate with Randy. He finally got to meet my husband, really liked him, and somehow got his phone number. At first I thought it was really sweet. But then the text messages started. Almost constantly wanting to talk. We both got multiple messages a day. Including ‘hello?’ messages when we didn’t reply fast enough. Eventually we had to tell him we are on vacation, trying to enjoy our time together and that we will call him when we got home. I thought he was just excited to see everyone from the wedding, and excited to meet now family members. But this was a warning of what was to come.


When we returned home from our honeymoon, things with Randy settled down for a while and our relationship was normal. But that was not the case for my cousin Tara.


Apparently since reconnecting at the wedding he started contacting her constantly. Constantly texting, calling her multiple times a day, and messaging her on all her social media platforms. It really freaked her out. It escalated to her receiving messages like ‘I can’t wait to hear your voice again’ and ‘you are so beautiful I can’t wait to see you again’ and other things that would be inappropriate to hear from your cousin. When she wouldn’t reply he would hound her will ‘hello? I can see you saw my messages’ and things like that. She was extremely uncomfortable, and ended up blocking him. That’s when he started reaching out to the rest of the family.


Myself, my mom, dad, sister, brother, another cousin, Taras mom, my grandparents, my husband, my NEW MIL AND FIL, and ALL HER FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK (Like he literally went down the list) received messages from Randy asking about Tara and why she won’t talk to him anymore. I was the one of the only people to give it to him straight, and I told him he made her uncomfortable and what he did to make her feel that way. Because I don’t think he understood those kind of boundaries. But he didn’t stop.


At this point my Aunt, Taras mom, confronted Randy’s parents about his behavior. Because he crossed a line. And it BLEW UP. I mean full on family feud. Randy’s parents refused to believe he did anything wrong, refused to even talk to him about it. It definitely divided the family, most siding with Tara and my Aunt.


Over the next few weeks more and more of my family ends up blocking him. And Randy realized I’m one of the few family members that still responds to him. But it’s always about Tara. I guess she had to change her number because of all of this. He was asking me to give him her number daily, asking me to message her for him, asking me to call her, asking me for my little sisters number so he can ask her about Tara. I remember after a long shift at work I had 16 texts from him about Tara, including ‘hello??’ and ‘have you read my message yet?’


Somehow he then got my sisters phone number and was doing the same thing to her.


It got so bad that my husband had to tell him to stop, and that really upset Randy. We end up taking on the phone for 3 hours one night because I was DONE. I told him he was acting inappropriately, that what he was doing was harassment. I had to teach him what harassment was essentially. I told him that he couldn’t use me to relay information to anyone else, and that I would never give him anyone’s phone number. 


At this point I was really starting to feel used and manipulated. He never even asked how I was doing, he didn’t care about anything going on in my life. I was all Tara. Have you heard from Tara today? Did you get her new number? Hello??? Did she respond to you? Have you texted her yet? I was just so fed up. I told him I was not going to discus anyone in our family at all. If he wanted to chat it was going to be about his life and my life only. At the end of the conversation he seemed to get it. He apologized and agreed we’d only discuss what was going on in our lives.


Well I didn’t hear from Randy for about 6 months after that. Until his attention turned to my sister, let’s call her Annie. Annie and I are close in the way you can go three months without talking, then pick up exactly where we left off. We get along great and I love my sister. But we are not involved in our day to day lives and at this point lived in different cities.


He started texting me constantly about my sister. Asking me to ask her to unblock him. Asking about her work schedule. Asking me to give him her number. Asking about her friends and wanting their phone numbers. I squash this pretty quickly and tell him to stop. And he does, for a few months he goes quiet and we don’t hear from him other than holiday wishes.


Now he wants us to watch him play his guitar. Ok cool sure. But he wants me to FaceTime him WITH my sister. I offer to watch him just me and my husband. No. Annie has to watch too. And this one goes on for MONTHS. At this point I’m so tired of trying to explain why she won’t talk him, tired of explaining why him hounding us is was wrong, so I ended up being more blunt with him. I told him Annie is creeped out and doesn’t want to talk to him. I tell him this, he wants to apologize, he wants her number, I refuse.


He stops talking to me for another 6 months.


But now Annie has a boyfriend. Somehow Randy finds out and is now obsessed with her boyfriend, we’ll call him Tanner. 


At this point Randy figures he needs to warm me up a bit to talk to me. I finally get a ‘hi how are you?’ before he asks me to give him Tanners number, I refuse (I also don’t actually have his number) and tell him to stop asking me for other peoples information because I won’t give it to him. So instead, Randy messaged ALL of Tanners family members on Facebook trying to get information on him. I’m talking parents, grandparents, and cousins. They all ignore him because Annie gave them a heads up. But I still thinks it’s ridiculous that he goes so far to contact someone. And I truly don’t know what his intentions are.


Fast forward to Christmas 2020. Randy has been quiet, but we still exchange holiday wishes, and check in once and a while. Anyway on Christmas I am talking with our grandmother. She tells me that during the time he was obsessed with my cousin Tara, he was also harassing another girl he went to high school with. Same thing. Messaging ALL of he Facebook friends, reaching out to her parents and aunts and uncles. Messaging her all all platforms. It gets so bad she had to call the cops on him! My grandma also ‘gave me permission’ to block him completely because I guess literally everyone else in our family has. She says Tara is terrified to see him and refuses to go to family events because she is AFRAID HE WILL ASSULT HER IF HE GETS THE CHANCE. And I feel just so gross about all of it. On one hand I am completely disgusted with his behavior and totally want to cut ties too. But on the other, I feel so incredibly bad for him. How lonely he must be, and that I’ve really been the only person in our family to communicate with him for years. I’m sympathetic to his problems, and still like to think of him as my cute little cousin. He really wasn’t talking to me at that time, so I didn’t end up blocking him.

But at this point I’m also furious because what are his parents doing? Why aren’t they involved? How are they completely ignorant to the situation? They have been made aware plenty of times, by plenty of people, but they choose to do nothing.


Fast forward to February 2021. I’m pregnant and I’m having a virtual shower for the family. It’s a big deal because this is the first baby in our family in 15 years! My wonderful MIL planned it and sent out cute party boxes for those that RSVPd. Including Randy’s mom. 


Five days before the shower, Randy messages my MIL. 
‘I saw you sent something to my mom, what is it?’
‘Oh it’s just some party favors for Dragonites baby shower’
‘Am I invited?’

My MIL knows all the history and tells him no, it’s just for the women of the family. In reality I don’t really care for too much gendered stuff like that, and there were men who were invited, as well as Tara and my sister Annie. But I was not going to have my invited guests feel uncomfortable because of Randy. Even if it was virtual.


He then messages me separately. Asking if he can play a song for everyone. I tell him no. He asks if he can sign on for just a minute. I tell him no. He tries to guilt trip me by saying things like ‘I just want to see my family again.’ And I shut that down. I told him straight up that I know he just wanted to see Tara and Annie, and that would make them uncomfortable and it was not an appropriate time to try and reconnect. I told him it was disrespectful to use my baby shower as a way to connect with people who did not want to see him. I really didn’t want any drama, and I definitely didn’t want Tara to have to see him. He was insistent that he wouldn’t do anything inappropriate and just wanted to say hi. I told him that it wasn’t the time or place for that, and respectfully asked him not to join the meeting with his mom. I even offered that we could maybe have a call separately with other family members another time. He agreed and said he wouldn’t join the meeting.


But then he messages my MIL again, asking her in secret to allow him to be at the shower, allowing him to play a song. She said no and shut him down. But really? You are going to go behind my back like that? And bother my MIL? I was pissed!


Then everyday leading up to my shower he is asking about a time and date to Zoom with Me, my husband, Annie and Tanner. The day of the shower I wake up to 3 messages about this zoom call with my sister. I tell him I’m overwhelmed by shower things and that we’d maybe plan it after a few days just to get him off my back. He agrees.


My shower goes off just fine, the games we planned were fun, and it was time to open presents. Then I hear Randy’s voice! ‘Hi everyone I just wanted to say hi and play you guys a song!’ I was so pissed! You can tell my sister and cousin were super uncomfortable! Luckily my MIL is awesome and shut that down pretty quickly. And he left the call after only a minute or two. But I felt so angry. So...violated in a way. I told him my boundaries and he chose not to respect that after claiming he understood.


Not even 5 minutes after the shower was over, he calls me. Why I picked up? I don’t know. He asks me if anyone saw him say hello. Everyone did Randy. He asks me if anyone heard him playing his guitar in the other room. No Randy. He asks if the next day we can zoom with my sister and her boyfriend. I’m like I don’t know her schedule. I’m so mad I get him off the phone quick. He messages me about it 4 more times that night about it. I ignored all of them.


He then texts my husband. He wants to know what he thinks about the conversation he and I had after the shower. My husband flat out said ‘nobody heard you play guitar’ and that was the end of that.


Randy then messages my MIL at MIDNIGHT. He’s upset. He thought it was supposed to be women only. He wants to know why he wasn’t invited. She ignores him and wakes up to a bunch of ????


At this point my husband is PISSED and lays into him kind of hard about messaging me and his mom too much. Randy apologized and went silent for a few days.


But only for a few days until he wants to zoom with Annie and Tanner again. He wants me to set up the call and plan it. I tell him that he makes them super uncomfortable, and if he wants to zoom with them, then he is responsible for mending that relationship and planning it himself. I offer to zoom with him just me and my husband, but he refuses. He wants it to be with everyone, or not at all. Just another ploy to get to people that don’t want to talk to him.


Over the last few days he keeps texting me over and over again asking about this call. Telling me he can’t get ahold at Annie and asking if I will talk to her. Asking me if I have heard from her yet. And I ignore him. I just can’t think of the words to say to him anymore. Annie and I live in different states, she has a crazy work schedule. I can’t force her to sit down and zoom call someone she doesn’t not want to talk to.


This morning I woke up to the same 3 messages copy and pasted over an hour early in the morning. 20 minutes apart. And I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I broke. I blocked him on my phone, Facebook, and Instagram.


I just couldn’t stand being used as a means of communication anymore. I’ve been shutting it down for 4 years! He’s never gotten any information out of me, but refuses to quit trying. He can’t even try to have a normal relationship with me. I am so offended that he ‘crashed’ my baby shower, after agreeing he wouldn’t. Harassing my MIL about it. And refusing to take no for an answer. I am just so completely done with this relationship. 


Even typing this right now I feel bad. I don’t want our relationship to be like this. I don’t want to be another family member that alienated him. But he clearly doesn’t value our relationship as more than just a means of communication with others. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel like a total asshole, but I’m 35 weeks pregnant and don’t need the stress!



Thank you to anyone who actually read this long ass post. I’m sure this was more of a vent and cathartic outlet for me, but I’d maybe like another perspective or advice on how to handle this situation moving forward.

Edit: Wow I really didn’t expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the awards! Also thank you for the kind works and encouragement. I’m definitely going NC and plan to stay that way. I’m also going to look into how to notify the school he works for about his outside behavior. Just to clarify a few things. We do live in different states, and he has no idea where I live. His parents are COMPLETELY aware of what’s going on, they choose to do nothing. And I absolutely stand by my sister and cousin. At times I felt like a shield for them, protecting them by shutting him down and telling him his actions were wrong. But sometimes it’s hard to make the right decision and hurt someone.

"I (25/f) feel like I cannot break up with my long distance boyfriend (30/m) because I am his source of future happiness, a solution to his death anxiety and depression, etc. It’s taking a toll on my mental health. I feel guilty and “selfish” if I try to break up.","I am honestly so exhausted to even go in detail. My long distance bf and I have been together for 16 months. It’s been very on/off, with all the breaks/breakups initiated on my end. 

He has had a history of mental health issues including severe death anxiety (fear/anxiety of his own death and also that of his parents), depression, anxiety in general. 

He claims I am the first woman he’s ever loved and that basically, envisioning our future together is what alleviates his death anxiety and such. 

He dropped out of high school and spent his time working, until he decided to go back to school.

He is generally deeply unmotivated. He uses me / our future as his “motivation” to finishing school/ applying for college. 

He spends all day playing video games and browsing reddit (lol) and watching Netflix. And then when he goes to bed, he gets severe anxiety that he just wasted another day, thus wasting his life. 

I have graduated from a prestigious university and was having a blossoming career, until recently. I have always been ambitious and hardworking and goal oriented, until this relationship (I suspect) has gradually broken me down.

Whenever I try to break up with my bf, he guilt trips me a lot.. 

I feel an extreme burden. Like I am what “keeps him going” basically. In terms of the “positives” of this relationship, I do know he really cares about me and he says he loves me so much. I can feel his genuine love and care for me — at the same time, I feel he is being selfish by trying to “keep” me for his benefit.. 

Tldr: Been in a long-term long distance relationship with my bf. He has a history of mental health issues and he clings onto me for his “happy” future. I feel weighed down and find myself losing all motivation in life, which starkly contrasts from how ambitious and lively I was before. I feel trapped and guilty for leaving him, largely because he makes me feel guilty and trapped if I want to leave. PLEASE HELP :(

Edit: Another thing he told me was that it took him 30 years to find love, and he won’t be able to find love again for the rest of his lifetime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gwqegy/i_25f_feel_like_i_cannot_break_up_with_my_long/,2020-06-04 21:14:30,goa
My gf found her nudes on her stepdad phone,"To begin I am 17 years old my girlfriend is also 17. Recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about 2 weeks during that time I gave her one of my old phones so we could still communicate using snapchat. We have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. We both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. About 4 days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him. Today he asked her to text him what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. We checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the time when the phone wasn't in her position. There was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent. Her mom does not know and is away for the next 4 days in a foreign country. She is currently there alone with her stepdad. What should she do?


UPDATE!!!.... She told her mom before she got back from said foreign country and her mom advised her to remain normal until she got back the next day. Her mom also made her stay at her grandma's house and when she got back she confronted her stepdad. Initially the stepdad denied it over and over but when her mom said she has proof he admitted to doing it and gave silly excuses why like saying ""he wanted to protect my gf"". My gf mom proceeded to kick him out and told him not to come back. He after hearing that he tried to stab himself with a screwdriver but her mom threatened to call the police and he left. It's been 2 days since that happened and he has continuously tried to guilt my gf mom and accused her of cheating soo he dosent look bad. Her mom is understandably devastated and completely confused (this was her Significant Other/husband for over 10+ years) and she has since sought therapy for advice on how to proceed. They've ultimately decided not to press charges and agreed that they just want him out of their lives",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fjvvcu/my_gf_found_her_nudes_on_her_stepdad_phone/,2020-03-17 00:39:59,tanda
My (F22) boyfriend (M24) has gone through some sort of personality change and no one seems to acknowledge it.,"
I understand how bizarre this situation sounds, but I honestly have no idea where else to go, at this point.

Some background: 
I’ve been with my boyfriend for around 4 years. He is sweet and kind and extremely empathetic. Our families like each-other, and we had plans to get married before the pandemic. Just before march we decided to go on holiday abroad. Another couple joined us later. ( John= husband, Kelly =Wife) It was lovely and we spent most of the time hiking or swimming in the lake. I speak the local language so i did most of the talking. All 4 of us are complete urban legend and dark tourism enthusiasts, so we went into the city for a tour. I spent most of the time translating because the translator there was only half doing her job. The urban legends weren’t really anything special, it was things we’ve already read about so we decided to split from the group. Kelly and I saw a salon still open so we went to go check it out, whilst John and my boyfriend went to check out some old church and ruins (John’s an archaeologist). 
After our nails had dried, kelly called John to see whats up, because she had something like 10 missed calls from him. We had our phones on silent. John was panicking and basically speaking gibberish. Kelly told him to slow down and finally managed to get that my boyfriend had fallen and now he’s lost. We basically ran out of the salon and ran over to the church. John was in a panic and had called the local police of OUR hone country, instead of the country here, so i immediately dialled the local number and they told us that they’d already been contacted and they were on their way. They then instructed us to remain where we were together. John was with Kelly in the woods, so i called them back, but it was pitch black and i fell apparently exactly where my boyfriend had fallen. I bashed my head against something, presumably a rock and im fairly sure I had a mild concussion since i was pretty disoriented from there on. The emergency services found my bf completely fine. Uninjured. A bit confused but thats it. We got driven back and John calmed down, but he was still more shaken than my boyfriend. We said goodnight to them and decided to take it easy the next day. My boyfriend slept for over 24 hours, and i got seriously concerned and checked a few times to make sure he was still alive. I briefly woke him up and made him drink water. He went straight back to sleep and woke up later. 

Main: 

I noticed something off immediately. As soon as he woke up his entire personality was just off. Like down to the tiniest things. His pattern of speech, his eye movements, his posture. I asked him repeatedly if he’s feeling better. We went out for lunch and he called me Jarissa. This is not my name. John and Kelly cracked up and teased him. We never knew anyone called Jarissa. Im sure that it wasnt another women and he isnt cheating. I’m completely sure of that. He also ordered a meal with tuna. I didnt say anything, but John made a remark saying he must be trying new things or something like that. My boyfriend absolutely despises tuna. It was small things like that, in addition to being much colder and quieter than usual. He is usually very outgoing and warm. On the plane back, we were snuggled up and he asked me to tell him “stories”. So i did, but he interrupted me and said “no stories about us”. So i did. And his response was off, as if he was hearing new information for the first time but pretending to have known all along. And then i told a fake story about skiing (he cant ski) with his family and he was nodding along. I made the decision to get him checked out for memory loss or something as soon as we were back. I was sleeping in the car ride home, and woke up briefly to him having taken us somewhere completely different instead of home. So i raised my concerns right there and then and told him he needs to get checked out. He stated that this was our home, and pointed to a house. He took the keys and walked up to the house and of course it didnt work. I demanded to drive back this time. The ride was extremely awkward. He couldnt open his phone,  because he had forgotten the passcode (thank god for face ID). I got a text and asked him to check it and he said “are you sure?”. This is what we normally do. We dont usually ask, we just check it for eachother. 

He also slept an extremely long time too. I went to the GP (General Practitioner. Sort of a family doctor) with him and told him point blank he needed to get checked out. I explained the situation to the doctor and he did a basic check up. We got a call the next day and the GP assured me that everything was completely OK. His cognition was apparently completely fine, no sign of long term or short term memory loss, which i argued against vehemently, seeing as he couldnt even remember his fucking passcode. The GP said that it was entirely possible he had some stress from the flight, since he has a mild fear of flying. I asked for a second opinion and evaluation, and the second GO also said theres no sign of head injury or anything and advised against seeing a neurologist without him. I called his mother to see if we could stay over for a while and his mother was happy to have us. She noticed a few changes in his personality but didnt really say anything much, just assumed that he was trying new things. His previous aversion to tuna had completely changed. I spoke to her in private and i mentioned other things too such as the fact he sleeps for incredibly long hours now, upwards of 9 hours, and how ive caught him staring at me sleeping and rifling through my journal, in which i keep pictures and notes of significant events for me. I also mentioned his coldness, and how his style of fucking has also completely changed and his smile is different. And then i started crying. Seriously i have no idea what to do. No one believes that something is wrong, but there is something so wrong with him. Its like his whole personality has shifted to the left. I entertained the possibility that it was a concussion which had caused me to assume that it was his fault, when in reality it was i who had made changes , but i have physical evidence and also evidence from his family that he has changed.

In videos his voice has changed, too. He way he speaks has changed. Literally any help is appreciated, thanks.

Edit: edited for general comprehension. Also, i didnt contact a neurologist because the GP had advised not to. He also refuses to go since the GP said everything is fine. This is over a year ago and the changes are still there. Its settled down a lot but he is no longer as outgoing or warm and does some thing where he stares at certain objects or people for too long and then looks in my general direction and back, robotically. He also talks in the third person occasionally and its seriously unnerving. For a while we slept in separate rooms because i was so creeped out by his behaviour change. Its like hes barely even human sometimes, i seriously have no other way to describe it. Like some lizard person or something, and it creeps the hell out of me. He speaks in his sleep, too and its not in english or any other language i know. But it isnt complete gibberish because there is a flow to it. This has continued on and was part of the reason i wanted to sleep separately for a while.

I’ll definitely be going to a neurologist myself tomorrow and explaining it, but there is little else i can do if he refuses to come along. 
(Sub edit: my boyfriend shuts down conversation everytime when i ask him what happened. He nearly opened up one time and started with “there was a goat” and then stopped and refused to say anything else. Its so bizarre. How does a goat relate to this??)

Edit 2: some of you seem to think im writing a horror story, so im making it abundantly clear right now: neither of us are religious or believe in ghosts, spirits or entities. I’m not stupid enough to do more than entertain that idea briefly. I am going to a neurologist tomorrow and going down the logical route rather than the “possessed by a demon” route.

**Edit 3**
I saw the doctor today on short notice, so the time slot was pretty small. My boyfriends mother agreed to go, as someone suggested bringing her along, and i showed her this post. I did most of the talking and the doctor seemed concerned. He said he will reference me to a neurologist but i need my boyfriend to come with me. Thats going to be the difficult part. If a doctor is expressing concern then i’m genuinely incredibly worried over the health of my boyfriend now. I was before, but now it seems serious, and i wasnt aware of the severity til yesterday. I have til 8pm tomorrow to get him to come, so any suggestions on exactly HOW to would be great.

#Also, addressing the people calling this fake and paranormal; just write off all possibility of ghosts, right now. 

I dont believe in any of that. A goat is entirely possible because there were goats that lived in this area, but i seriously have no idea how that could link to him getting lost or why he stops talking there. He could have followed a goat and got himself lost? It doesn’t mean its paranormal, and i refuse to consider that seeing as there are a vast number of logical explanations.

Also, people telling me to break up with him: no.

#Edit 4

I convinced him to come to see a neurologist who specialises in brain injuries. Long story short; nothing. They scanned him, brought him in for psychological evaluation too. They tried telling me that perhaps there was something wrong with me, until i used video evidence. Today they did some blood work on him, since i mentioned swimming in lakes, and we’re expecting results maybe in a week or so. He’s going back tomorrow to see a psychiatrist, since there isnt anything obviously wrong in terms of injury to his brain. 

He was sulky with me for a while, but we’ve just rescued a litter of kittens so that requires us to talk to one another.

For example, I’ll work really hard on making progress with a trade I took in school in order to improve. Then I’ll feel comfortable, and stop working on it. People I know will continue to improve, and then suddenly I’m rusty and “behind” and feel a little confused at how everyone got so much better.

"I'm depressed, poor, out of shape, and just got a job!","I've lived a very impoverished life. I was abused as a kid, bullied, and it's had an awful effect on my mental health. In my late teens (17-19) I dropped out of high school to raise my baby brother from 1 month to 18 months, I took in my two younger sisters aged 15 and 16, and I was tough because that's what I had to be. I worked and provided for my siblings. I tried my best to be flexible, understanding, and 2 parents to my siblings since that what I felt they deserved. With the last one off to college and my brother being taken back by his mother. I have been alone. With nobody to live for the shadow has grown immensely and taken over me. 

I went through depression like I have never experienced, gained weight, became suicidal, and lost my drive. I find it hard to live for myself because I don't feel I'm worth it. I blame myself for the abuse and have always hated myself because of it. My self confidence, worth, and image are awful and toxic. However I'm an optimist, out going, supportive, and outwardly positive person. I try and not let other people know I'm hurting. 

I have been unemployed since March due to covid. The past couple weeks the well was starting to look empty, so I began job hunting. Applying for everything and every job I got offered a position into a corporate manager training program. Don't ask me how. I've only ever worked as a cook or server in restaurants. My car broke down and junked months ago. So I was looking at working within biking distance at a local restaurant when I was offered the position. 

Now I'm looking at working downtown and I live an hours walk to the nearest bus station and an hour and a half away by bus. I was thinking about renting a car weekly, but I'm not sure. I need to do some math and find out what's the most efficient, what's the most realistic solution, and see where I can find a middle ground. I will make it work. This opportunity is phenomenal and I won't let it slip away. I don't want to fall into any pitfalls though. I don't know how to work in a professional office, I don't own any ""business professional"" clothes, and I don't want to look stupid or undeserving. Also any financial advice would be hugely accepted. 

My parents have failed me immensely and I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff. I.e. be an adult 

P.s. through their failures I have grown what they could not teach. I'm thankful I was able to be there for my siblings and hold no ill feelings. They didn't grow up and so it is what it is. 

Tl;dr my first professional office job and I don't know what to wear, say, or act. I also am asking for advice on how I should handle my finances. I'm broke always been broke, and I'm tired of that. Thanks in advance for anyone for reading


**Update
Update* I started my job. The bus isn't bad there, but im almost wrapped up with training. So I'll have to start having to secure regular transportation. Work is so new and weird. Everyone's so well dressed, but im getting by. I definitely feel out of place they all have sports coats I think their called. On the bright side the two hours there and back on the bus are great for studying, memorizing, and practicing. 

I've met with my bosses mentor and he seems like a great guy. I was told to ask him some questions, but I couldn't really think of any.
I ended up getting help from the assistant manager to ask personal questions or questions I genuinely need help with. I explained that I've always lived my life for others, so now that im on my own I find it difficult to get motivated, make goals, or take control. He gave great advice. It was obviously genuine and I think I might've caught him off guard. It was nice getting advice. Honestly it felt like what I imagine having parents in the picture would be like. We talked other topics and I think it went well.

 Also I love my boss. He's a great guy who leads well, has good intentions, and trusts his gut. I think it's a terrific fit and these are good people. I feel safe, but this is just week one. Thanks again everyone for well wishes. 

P.s. I got a little worried for a second on day 3 because I started to be a little toxic. Thinking ""I don't deserve to be here, can I really do it, I should quit, quit now before you fail and let everyone down"". I pushed that aside and thought if im comfortable than im not growing and I need to push myself.

I may have fucked a 3 year friendship,"So, here it goes

 I have been great friends with a great gay friend (i'm 19M, she is 18F). Let's cal her Sue. She is the coolest person i know and i really feel like she was a person you meet once in a lifetime. The problem is, i have a really bad habit of running late and forgetting things, so i always ran late when we had to meet up and hang out. It wasn't a big deal when i ran late for like 10 minutes or something, but i used to be late for 30 minutes or more. But she forgave me. Every.  Fucking. Time. I don't know why i keep doing it, but i simply can't seem to manage my time. I procrastinate, i run late, i don't pay attention, i'm a hot mess if you will. Yet, apart from all that, she still forgave me. She was the best friend ever. 

Now, here's when i fucked up the most. Started college, met a girl (19F), let's call her Becky. I really like her, so we start talking, she played League with me, i asked her out, it was swell. Until one day, when she invited me to go to the mall with her. I say yes, of course, and go. The thing is, i had to meet with Sue the same day at 8 o'clock. So, i figure, i go at 7:30 there to meet up. The thing is... I forgot, completely. At 7:45 i get a call asking me if i'll make it on time. I say sure, but i kept staying with Becky cuz you know, i like her and shit. I get onto the bus at 7:50, and meet up wth Sue at fucking 8:45. 

Poor Sue had to wait for my fucking self for 50 goddamn minutes in the cold. I meet up with her, and I walk her home. This time it was different. She was understandably mad. We didn't talk, and halfway, she started to simply say: ""You know, I think you just don't care. I had a shit day, and was looking forward to meeting with you, but yet you had me wait for 50 fucking minutes"". I felt devastated. I really care about her, you know but yet, i still forgot, i still was an asshole. I thought with my dick instead of my brain.

I feel like an asshole, like i'm the worst friend ever, and maybe i am. I don't want this to end, but i simply don't know what to do

I can’t even cry I’m so mad,"My bf of 3 years and I have been going through a rough patch the last few month. We were working on it. Today I saw an Instagram message on his phone from what I thought was a guy. Turns out it wasn’t it was a girl. 
a girl who he’s been talking to for months. Calling her baby. Driving an hour to pick her up. Missing work to go out with her. Sending voice messages to her.  
he sees nothing wrong with it. 
I feel like shit knowing for at least the past two months I’ve been here not knowing. How tf do I know he’s not fucking her. 
he lives at my house rent free, refuses to help with anything and while we were going through the rough patch I told him do not entertain other girls which make sense since we still live together and he insists we still sleep in the same bed, etc. 
he says it isn't cheating and he still loves me. At this point I’m beyond done. It isn’t the first time he’s done something like this but it’s the first time he’s actually met up with a girl. 

I’m upset and hurt and idek what to do. There’s no coming back from this.

"How do I (32 M) convince my 16 year old daughter that her new ""boyfriend"" sucks.","My daughter is a brilliant girl, she's just graduated high school and is about to enter college at SIXTEEN. When I was her age I was an absolute idiot (Shit I mean I HAD her when I was sixteen). However when it comes to seeing red flags/character flaws, my daughter is kind of stupid. My daughter is an adult in my eyes, she has a scholarship full ride, a job and is pretty self sufficient, so there is NO guerrilla style parenting to be done, I just need to convince her with logic that her new boyfriend is a total piece of shit. Essentially she started dating this 18 year old guy we'll just call Devon 2 months ago. Devon rubbed me the wrong way instantly, he's a college football player of like 6'4 with blonde hair (Just imagine a stereotypical rich douche bag who plays football in school). When we first met he was trying to charm me the best he could with a disgustingly superficial mask. When I first went to dinner with his family and my daughter there were multiple red flags I spotted instantly when paying attention to their relationship dynamic. When Devon's parents asked her questions Devon would motion her to stop talking and then talk over her, he'd constantly tell my daughter what to do and when, he seemed super controlling. I did a background check on him and what do you know, he had a DUI from like 8 months ago when he had first turned 18.

I had also noticed little things as well, such as one time I watched him drop my daughter off and he didn't know I was watching, and he was speeding at like 40 in a residential before dropping her off and peeling out like a douche. I really just don't like this kid and he seems EXACTLY like my ex wife who was a fucking psychotic bitch who made my life hell every day. Thing is, I can't really do dick about it. I'm not a prude, I make super explicit disturbing music for a living and have had a criminal past before so I ABSOLUTELY do not believe in trying to control or forcefully direct an almost adult into doing what I think is right for them. If I tell her she can't be with him, she'll just blow me off and move in with him, what am I going to restrain my daughter from leaving the house??

I'm really scared for my daughter and if this fucking piece of shit gets her pregnant I will be immensely sad at the pain everyone will face in the future. And SURE, maybe he's not such a bad dude after all and his flaws will mature with him and they'll go through ups and downs for the next decade or so, that's all great but I REALLY do not want that ghetto unstable life for my daughter, I would know I've been through it.

My partner gained a lot of weight and I don't know how to approach the fact that I'm less attracted to her,"Hi all, it's a controversial topic and I'm not sure where to turn for advice, but I'm hoping this Reddit is a good place to start. Over the years my partner has gained considerable weight. I do everything I can to support her but at the same time I have noticed that I am becoming less physically attracted to her. I've just supported her whenever she mentioned wanting to eat more healthily and parked my feelings beyond that. Recently however, she has been noticing herself that I'm less attracted to her and started asking about it. I don't know how to approach that conversation, as I am afraid that the way I explain my feelings can have a very bad impact on her, as this is understandably a highly sensitive subject. Any advice is welcome.

EDIT: Hey everyone. Thank you for all your advice. This post received a lot more traction than I expected. I'm very happy with all the great tips and advice, but at the same time it's become too much for me to reply to all of it. So to everyone; thank you.

EDIT2: Here's how I ended up addressing the problem; first, I gained some perspective through all your help. It made me realize that I was still very much attracted to her, but that I was feeling helpless; we want to get another child but she recently told me her weight might be hindering her fertility, which was not something I had on my radar and it made me panic and focus too much on her weight. I went to Reddit because she saw I was in a bad place and I was being distant because I didn't know what to do with it. In the end I bought her some flowers and apologized for being cold the previous night.  We talked about what I was going through and what she's been going through.

They share a group of friends. He's made it clear he ""can't"" be around her, so she's isolated at school. For a bit of other info, she and my other daughter used to joke that he was cute but""looked like a school shooter.""  White, average, quiet, last guy you'd expect etc...

Anyway, after she broke up with him (he's in an art magnet program), he began drawing things and posting them on Instagram essentially indicating that without her every day was the same ... Boring, dead inside, depression.  Also, she's never had a BF but he has had a GF that he remains on good terms with. 

So my daughter tells me he came to school this week in black jeans, black boots, blacj shirt, and a black beanie. She said she was immediately frightened bc that's SO far from his normal dress. She ""jokingly"" said "" so if I die it was X...and he knows my schedule.""

I'm a teacher.  And I still don't know what to do.  Please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/emzwk7/should_i_be_afraid_a_rejected_boyfriend_will_hurt/,2020-01-11 00:27:48,agra
Is it okay for men to wear sports bra?,"I (21M) started to become fat in the sophomore year of college and my breast, or man boobs, grew big. I want to exercise, jog, and start a new healthy life but whenever i exercise these moobs get in the way. Although im not suppose to be insecure about this, but i am. I read in journals that its okay for men to wear sports bras for support. But i wanted to tell my gf (21F) first for extra moral support. Anyway she said it was weird for men to wear bras but she thought it was for everyday use. I still emphasized SPORTS bra so she completely understood. Her answers felt judge-y and i think it trampled on my insecurity and made it worse

Tl;dr
Is it okay for me to wear a sports bra?

Edit 1: My gf is 100% supportive of me in this. She thought it was weird at first. I was affected by this because i am really sensitive about this topic. But she's okay and really supportive! 

Edit 2: i didn't realize it would get so much comments. Thank you for the supports. All your comments were heartwarming. I feel empowered to achieve my goals. Thank you reddit users!

Help for a mentally ill child,"2 weeks ago my aunt dropped her three kids off at my home unannounced for a “visit” and hasn’t been back since. I’ve been in contact with the police and other family members and I’ve made them as comfortable as possible while they’re here. 

All of the kids are devastated at being abandoned, understandably, but I need some advice on how to handle the middle child. 

She’s 9 years old and has Oppositional Defiant Disorder. She’s been struggling with it since being here and I’m completely unequipped on handling it. I can’t take her to see a professional because of Corona, and also because I have no parental rights. 

Is there anyone here with any experience with children with ODD? Any advice would be helpful, I just want to make this situation easier for her. She’s the sweetest kid. 

Thank you!

Edit: yes she is professionally diagnosed, this is more than just bratty behaviour. 
I’m going to try and do some art with her, and help her find some practical coping mechanisms.

Another edit: thank you everyone! I get pretty easily overwhelmed so I’m sorry if I can’t reply to everyone but thank you call from the bottom of my heart!!!
My 3 cousins are the sweetest kids and I want what’s best for them. I’ve contacted both the police and DOCS (department of child services) and my fiancée and I are going to try and get emergency custody for them.

My wife and I have been stalked/harassed for roughly 6 years now.,"I'll try to keep this brief. At this point we don't know what to do and could use some advice.

My wife and I have been together for over 8 years. Over that time we've been sporadically getting spammed with fake social media accounts impersonating my wife and fake phone numbers texting us saying very inappropriate things and even threatening us a few times. 

Over the years it's even spread to our family members being harassed on social media and even in texts. But it always has mention of my wife being ""unfaithful"" to put it softly. And always references our lives, not the family members. So it seems targeted.

They have mentioned personal things about my side of the family and also her side of the family.

At first we suspected a crazy ex-girlfriend of mine because I've had a few, but recent developments point away from that hypothesis since they know private things that have recently happened in our lives (her pregnancy which is a secret outside of close friends and immediate family, and a wedding this past weekend that we have not posted anything about and did not even attend). 

We changed our numbers 2 years ago and haven't gotten bothered via text since. And only have Instagram as social media. It was relatively quiet the past year or so until today. They somehow got her father's phone number and is harassing him as though he is my wife. And mentioning these things that only a select few people know.

We went to the police already and they said they can't do much, but that they will keep a file of it. I thought it may be some type of data mining bot or malware, or maybe they have access to someone in our families social media accounts. We're really not sure. Could malware or a bot mine this type of information?

Any advice on what to do here would be great.

TL;DR - My wife and I have been getting harassed and threatened going on about 6 years now. It's someone who is masking their phone number and identity. We've tried the police but there's not much they can do. I suspect it's some type of data mining bot or malware but I'm not sure.

Edit/Update #1: For all of you wanting updates I will provide here. We handed over all information (screenshots, Instagram handles, etc.) to the police and filed a report. Each state has different cyber crime laws and I believe where we live now is much more strict than NJ (where we used to live). Police will provide an update within the next week. If they can't subpoena any text records we will reach out to a PI. And we are even considering a free consultation with a harassment lawyer as they may also be able to subpoena records.

Edit/Update #2 (8/2/21): No major updates but didn't want to leave people hanging. It's taking a little longer because her father lives in a different town than we do, so a different jurisdiction. So the police from both towns are working together on it. Will update when we have more info!

Edit 3/Update 3 (9/16/21): Nothing is moving forward right now. Apparently the police ""don't have enough"" to build a case yet. Especially since most of it happened out of state where we used to live. And the person has stopped with the harassment for the time being. It's frustrating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o9mpti/my_wife_and_i_have_been_stalkedharassed_for/,2021-06-28 15:35:16,alwar
Guy who I planned to go on a date with killed frogs and baby birds and now I no longer want to date him.,"I (17f) agreed to go on a date with a guy I work with (18m) after a month of him crushing really hard on me. He's alright to talk to so when he asked me out I said yes. 

I don't have a Snapchat but one of my friends who does told me that he posted videos of shoving hooks through live frogs and killing baby birds in a nest with rocks and laughing throughout the whole process. I am VERY disgusted and disturbed as I love animals. She told me this after I agreed to go on a date with him.

My first reaction is to tell him that I no longer want to go on a date with him. I'm feeling very nervous as I have a hard time rejecting people or saying no in general. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not but the thought of him killing animals for no reason is making me sick. What would be a good way to tell him I don't want to date him?

Short update: I am planning on texting him tonight or tomorrow (I'm worried about how he would react in person) and telling him why I don't want to date him. I know a few of y'all said to make up an excuse but the only times I see him are at work and he doesn't know where I live so I'm not afraid of him trying to hurt me. I'm going to tell him the reason is because he hurt animals (ofc I'll tell him off) because I think he needs to know and to realize what he did was wrong. I'm very nervous and texting him right now is weird. I've noticed he's grown increasingly serious about me going over to his house to watch a movie, which was something I wanted to point out because it felt odd.  I'll update after I tell him. Thank you all for your replies.

Big update: I've never had any of my posts on reddit blow up like this. First of all thank you all for being supportive. I am a big people pleaser so rejecting anyone is difficult. These messages made me feel much more confident in cancelling our date. 

From now on I'm gonna call this guy Mike. 

A lot of you were interested in more background information so I'll give some first. We work at a popular fast food restaurant and I just started a couple months ago. Mike is one of my managers which makes this whole situation scarier to me. Prior to working here we went to school together. I never noticed him as I usually don't stare at people while walking to class and he was a grade above me. In these past few days he admitted to having a crush on me for a much longer time because apparently I passed him in the hallway every day. At the time I had a boyfriend. Mike said he hated my boyfriend and even went off on how much he didn't like him because he was jealous my ex got me and he didn't. 

I also wanted to mention how Mike asked me out. There is a couple guys at work who have a crush on me. One of them asked for my number and I made up some excuse to say no and he started to become increasingly serious about dating me. I told Mike this. To be clear he is my manager and I was trying to talk to him about another employee making me uncomfortable with their advances. His response was ""well he would leave you alone if you went out with me...?"" Looking back this was extremely inappropriate of him. I mostly said yes because of being afraid of how he would respond if I said no. 

Sorry, more information. The frogs were for bait. Some of you asked that. To all of you I'm just gonna say that frogs shouldn't be used for bait and just because they aren't cute and cuddly doesn't mean they can't feel pain. Please stop commenting that ""it's okay because he might be using the frogs for bait"". 

Now I'll get into what happened last night and what I plan on doing. Many of you told me not to bring up the animals, many of you told me to. I went with my gut feeling. I texted him and told him I didn't want to become involved with someone who hurt animals. He immediately denied everything and started blowing up on me. He was sending paragraphs about how he would never and how he's offended I would even think that. I was trying to be calm but he just kept blowing up about how I'm a bad person for not trusting him. He eventually admitted to doing it but said killing the baby birds was an accident (how do you accidentally kill birds while recording it?) and he said that the frogs were a friend's idea and not his (his friend said it was his idea?). Even if the frogs weren't his idea he still should have stood up to his friends. He was sending so many messages I got overwhelmed but at least now the date is off. 

 Once again, I will not seek out these videos. Many of you are asking for proof but I really cannot stand videos or pictures of animals hurt. I trust my coworker's word for it (and him admitting to it). I asked different people at work about it and they all talked about it, which confirms that it happened to me. Mike's friend (who went with him on the trip and who I mentioned) told me how he felt bad the whole time and the animals deaths was Mike's idea. 

A lot of you also mentioned reporting him. One of my managers is a close friend so I plan on talking to him as soon as I can. Getting the police involved makes me nervous so I plan on telling my mom and seeing if she'd help me report him. 

I'm sorry this was so long. I wish I just rejected him from the start. Thank you all for your supportive messages and thank you for the award!!

8 years,"I’ve been in a relationship for over 8 years. We almost got married. I’ve never met his mom. He lives with her. For years everyone thought he had a wife. Nope. That would be more understandable. But literally he’s afraid to leave. He proposed then decided it was more important to take care of his mom. It’s like a Norman Bates thing. He’s 44 and never lived alone. So do I toss 8 years?

Edit. I’ve been to his house many times because she’s been in the hospital. I’ve asked to meet her thousands of times and he says I promise and never allows it. He says it’s too much for her and he doesn’t want her to know his business. She’s too controlling. Also she would be upset because she’s afraid to lose her care taker. I’ve offered to help and he says it’s too much for her to meet someone. She’s too mentally clouded. It’s been just him and her since she divorced his father at 8.

I also want to say I’ve met everyone in his family in his dads side. His mom has no family. He has 2 step brothers and one half brother from his dad and they invite me everywhere. His sister in law loves me. And they have never met his mom either.

So I left. He said he didn’t like ultimatums and it’s definitely my fault. That sucked but ya know. Life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g6e02l/8_years/,2020-04-23 01:43:51,tanda
I was kidnapped as a child and now I'm not sure how to live the rest of my life please help,"When I was young I was kidnapped and then I lost my family for a while. I've spent the rest of my childhood trying to move on from everything that happened. I've worked hard to get perfect grades and supportive friends and I've even been doing therapy to help with the trauma. I'm a senior now, and I'm realizing that no matter how much I work there are some things in my past I will never be able to get away from.

The incident left me with very little financial support and very little ability to get need based financial support for college. Past college I don't have any real support either or any idea how to make sure I get into the career I want since I had no examples as a child. Emotionally, whenever I get into new relationships I always feel so guilty because I have so many secrets about what happened to me and if I tell them they don't how to handle that. 

My biggest goal is to move on from the incident and be more financially and emotionally free but I'm a little lost about how to do that.  I would be so thankful for any advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/mpuim0/i_was_kidnapped_as_a_child_and_now_im_not_sure/,2021-04-13 03:51:18,goa
I called my coworker a pervert and he is mad at me (need unbiased opinion(s)),"I have a coworker(M28 great personality with good sense of humor) sitting beside me(F26) has been for few weeks commenting on my dressing style (which is casual wear, I always rotate same clothes every week) and told me that I should dress more feminine so I can attract attention from guys (apparently I have been complaining to my other coworker that I don't have a bf). he even told me what to wear (e.g. a floral dress, corp top etc). 

Just today he kept suggesting what I should wear to work tomorrow. I told him to not talk about it anymore. later he showed a coworker's instagram post (female wearing one suit bikini) made a remark ""she got 200 likes by wearing like this, imagine how many likes she'll get if she is wearing nothing"". I got offended by his comment on her and said ""if you keep commenting like this you gonna look like a pervert"" and he got visibly upset by my reply and proceed to tell me that my remark on him is degrading to him and also his to family. 

My other coworker(F27) got upset that I confronted him instead of telling my supervisor and that he is going to use my remark against me. I didn't want to look like a petty employee by reporting every single problem I have with my coworkers. 

I'm now conflicted on how to proceed with this...

update edit: 

Hey guys, thanks for all the replies on this thread. 
I have decided to let this slide as he is not talking to me at this moment and decided to not talk to him unless about work stuff. 

For the ones who said it's not okay to call out names/insult  him, I am not feeling guilty since it was one to one conversation and if he didn't get my point I can't help him. 

Escalating to HR will be harsh. I am not trying to make him the bad guy. I hope he understand that I wasn't insulting him and reflect on his behaviour towards others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fctkgz/i_called_my_coworker_a_pervert_and_he_is_mad_at/,2020-03-03 12:02:03,agra

My lack of motivation and difficulty waking up is ruining my life,"I don't believe I suffer from depression. I love setting goals and dreaming about what I can achieve. However, my habits and lack of discipline are ruining my chances of achieving those goals. 

I generally have a really hard time waking up in the mornings. It's not that I'm a heavy sleeper. I hear the alarm, or even wake up on my own, but in that moment, nothing is more important to me than getting a bit more sleep. It doesn't matter if I sleep for 6 hours or 10 hours. I also tend to have mid-day crashes when I can hardly keep my eyes open, so I usually take a 2-hour nap if I'm at home. 

I used to be able to motivate myself and get work done quite well in my early 20s. Now in my late 20's, it has become increasingly difficult. I plan what needs to be done, I organize my thoughts and I know that I have to do them if I want to achieve my goals, but executing those tasks seems unbelievably difficult. Subconsciously I will make excuses or just slack off until my focus is completely gone, and I have to leave it for another time. 

I'm not sure if those issues are related, but they are ruining my life. I know I have so much more potential and can achieve so much more, and it just seems silly to have these mental roadblocks in place, and yet I don't know what to do to overcome them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/gdftz0/my_lack_of_motivation_and_difficulty_waking_up_is/,2020-05-04 17:23:33,goa
How to Save a Loved One while Saving Yourself?,"Hello, I am a sixteen year old male and I have...family issues.  See a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ala9mq/needadvice_parents_are_negatively_affecting_my/) for backstory.

Long story short, I have well-meaning, loving parents that are also toxic addicts who do not wish to improve themselves in any shape, way, or form.  Also, most of my family members (that I am aware of) live the complacent and lazy drug abuse lifestyle, as well.

Anyways, I have devised a way to proceed in my own life, whilst discovering myself and the world around me.

Wonderful, right?  It is, but there is one problem:  I have a sister I care deeply about and she is rather young and impressionable.  Let's call her Jane.  Jane is a intelligent and hard-working sibling that I am HIGHLY proud of and each day, I try to teach her as mush knowledge as I can and embrace good habits as much as I can, ranging from simplicity like brushing teeth to exercising and eating right every day.

To accomplish my own goals and to achieve my own life, I must leave my family behind to go abroad and learn from experience.  I have already looked into emancipation and it is looking very promising.

Jane has so, so much potential to live a wonderful life and I want to assist her as much as I can.The problem occurs when I am literally the only positive influence in her life.  I am the only one that cares enough what she eats, how much she sleeps, how much playtime she has had, how much she has learned, etc.  Everyone else around her encourages her to be lazy, to always blame and accuse others (for trivial or for large things alike), to eat junk, to stay up all night, and actively discourages her from going outside, brushing her teeth, or doing literally anything that will make her life actually worthwhile.

I am beyond stressed out knowing that if I leave now at Jane's most impressionable time, she will develop the worst habits humanly possible and will fall into the rut of laziness and complacency like all my other family members.  This is absolutely guaranteed to destroy Jane's life.  I have already lost one of my sisters to the toxicity, what do I do?  I so want to improve myself, but I refuse to sacrifice Jane to live the good life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/cvau9l/how_to_save_a_loved_one_while_saving_yourself/,2019-08-25 16:45:51,goa

"My kid has been bullied and I've been assaulted by his coked up mother, I don't know what to do as I'm afraid going to police will make it worse","So this woman let's call her Mary lives on my road, she has two sons (7&8) and I have a son who is 7 and a daughter who is 5. Her kid (the 7 year old)  has often beat up my kid and I know boys fight but it got out of hand. A bit over a month ago I called to her to have a word and she seemed reasonable enough. Now other stuff has happened in between and I didn't want to keep knocking her door all the time. Two days ago my grandmother was looking after my children while I was at work, and her children were knocking my door and running away, and calling my grandmother names and telling her to fuck off, so my gran went around to her house, where she was hanging out the top Window and shouted down a whole bunch of stuff, and when my gran left Mary then proceeded to knock my door looking for me (but I was at work) so on my way home I called my gran and she told me she had an argument with Mary and she was knocking the door looking for me, so i called to her house on my way home. She was as high as a kite (her partner is a drug dealer, Coke as far as I know) and was screaming and shouting and just going off tangent, I was asking her repeatedly what had happened but she was just rambling on about me always knocking her door (I knocked once before this as she was looking for me that's why I was at the door this time) and she jumped me, I grabbed her back  but her kids came out with the dog (the dog is a staffie with clipped ears very intimidating) and I didn't feel like getting mauled by the dog so I let her go, and just took the punches and kicks, I couldn't run off because she had me by the hair. her bf was also there and he had to drag her off me, but shouted at me that I had better not go to the gardai (police) or else. So now I'm at a loss as what to do. I feel like I can't let my kid out to play which isn't fair on him but what if more shit like this happens? What if she takes it further? I'm so anxious over the whole situation.

Why am I so bad at everything no matter how hard I try?," 

I grew up being bad at everything. I’m tired of people pointing at me and laughing like I’m a clown. I'm in my mid-thirties and this is still a problem.

I’d rather have people see me as competent than be someone who gets laughed at.

Yet when I say this, people think I’m psycho, do we not have shame anymore? Are we supposed to like junk?

I went through culinary school with 13+ years in the restaurant business. You make a bad dish as a chef and people are going to remember you as the crappy chef who made a garbage dish, and they will pay with their wallet and either the customer based falls out (because they tell people) or the headchef tells you to stop being an idiot and you get fired.

I’d rather be good at something and be remembered for that than I would be remembered for being a laughing stock.

It's been like this on my dad's side of the family. We work ourselves into the ground, pushing 110%, if that doesn't work, 120% and so forth and we barely even achieve our goal. Yet someone can glide by and do 20% of the work and end up achieving greatness.

Is there something wrong with me? I was always told that you get out of this world what you put into it. I need answers and no one seems to have them, so I'm asking Reddit because I'm desperate here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/htqzui/why_am_i_so_bad_at_everything_no_matter_how_hard/,2020-07-19 00:02:44,goa
"I feel like a prisoner in my own home, please help. Thank you.","So I was going to make this a throw away in case my family saw it, but honestly if that happened at least it would be out in the open. I am 22, originally british, but moved to the U.S. at 11. Ever since I was 9 i have been home schooled because it seemed easier and I have dyslexia. I think you can see where this is going.

When i first moved to the US i had no reason to leave the house, no friends, nothing. When I say no friends i mean it. In addition to this my emotionally abusive grandmother was still alive at this point, so I had a few ""close calls"" where my life is concerned. Point is, my life is a fucking blur from 11 to like 19. 19 is when I started practicing Kung Fu, I love kung fu so much, I'm shit at it, but I love it so so much. I am currently 22, in my last year of UNI, which i am failing horribly because my teacher is an idiot (promise). I can't drive, i have no friends, never had a job, once again you get the idea.

I cannot drive because my parents have taken... two years to each me so far? And they keep stopping because we live in the far north of the US. So it's always fucking snowing. Obviously I'm EXTREMELY lonely, and have no social skills. My father is the child of Cypriot immigrants so he always grew up in really tight knit, greek only speaking family, so he doesn't understand why I'd want to branch out. And my mother, well, I don't know. I have attempted many ways of making money from home with the goal of someday moving out, painting, digital art, book covers, and writing. I've written finished three books, only one has been published (they all have to go through my mother first). But I've written five in total... I have an etsy shop where I try to make money, but it's not a lot (i made 30 this month, which is a lot for me. But  even if I did make enough to leave, I'd still be a foreigner in a country I barely know anything about, and my parents would be so offended. Oh, also my brother is five years older and still lives with us, he seems to have no plans to move out...

This whole post has been prompted by an earlier fit of crying, rage and what have you. Normally I would speak to my family about my concerns when i get like this, but every time I have they make promises and then are all forgotten in a few weeks time. In addition to this my mother always seems to try and ""fix"" my concerns with food, so if I cry in front of her she just tells my dad to buy some chocolate and then shoves it in my mouth.  Also my parents ALWAYS discourage me from getting a job, and yeah, I can't drive anyway to get to the job so, I'm fucked.

DID I MENTION I'VE WRITTEN MULTIPLE BOOKS BUT I CAN'T PUBLISH THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH MY MOTHER?????

I love my parents, really i do. But I'm trapped. I am a princess in a fucking tower, that also knows kung fu, but still trapped none the less... Which sucks, i feel like a fucking cliche. Anyway I'm coming down from the crying now, and I am slowly resigning myself to my fate of living with my parents until I'm 33, marrying the first man my mother points out, and getting a house next to theirs. HEY MAYBE I'M JUST ON MY PERIOD, AM I RIGHT? THE FELLAS KNOW. (sorry that made me laugh)

I guess the cause of my paralysis is a fear of failure due to the fact that I am in my mid 20s and don't have the cushion of being in my early 20s. Not to be fatalistic, but it seems that mistakes now have a greater gravity to them. 

I have major deficits in my character ranging from a lack of self confidence to procrastination and lack of stamina. I can already tell my sister is losing respect for me, and my parents are fed up. They have the impression that I have been sitting on my ass, idling about when the reality is the opposite. 

For fucks sake, my sister is about to start her graduate studies in a top tier British university, and here I am rotting away. This is beyond a nightmare, but I am adamant on making a change, so I don't literally die, as I have a chronic disease on top of this. I don't seek any sympathy.  I just need some advice for clarity sake. I just want a change. I can't go on like this for the remainder of the year.

My mother keeps inviting herself to follow me to my new city,"I move across the country to start a new job soon. It's the first time that I will live outside the Midwest and my mother is not taking to the distance well, even though we have never had a particularly close or positive relationship.

In the last couple of weeks, she has started telling other people (family members, neighbors, colleagues) that she is going to come visit me for **three months** next winter. Apparently, she has cleared it with her boss that she can work remotely in that time so long as she gives notice. She has yet to tell me directly of this plan even as she actively irons out the details. 

I am deeply uncomfortable with her tailing after me, especially for such a long period of time. How do I broach this conversation with her knowing that doing so will hurt her feelings and that she will adamantly deny that her planning to fly out has anything to do with me moving in order to save face?",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/njgcb6/my_mother_keeps_inviting_herself_to_follow_me_to/,2021-05-23 20:24:58,daman
My sister works at Walgreens and is underpaid and over-worked. She likes it there but can't move up. Im her sponsor now (8 days),"Hello. So here's my problem, or my sister's rather. She works at a Walgreens in Wisconsin. Her and three other employees are basically doing the manager's job. I know this is nothing new but hear me out! I have also had similar experiences, a few were even successful. I believe that in the midst of the pandemic some companies are using the chaos as an excuse to shuffle employees jobs and titles around and put advancement in the company on hold. An employee that used to be a manager got bumped down to my sisters position but still retains the $2.50 pay increase (yes he is a man if you were already thinking it). She recently had her wisdom teeth removed and while still healing was guilted into working for another employee who called in sick. Being a former salaried manager i can tell you that was MY job. She's asked her useless manager for a raise but apparently there is a cap per position. So instead of getting paid more, the manager gets paid more and does less and less leaving the employees to pick up the slack. I told her to go above her manager to the next in line which is what i did at a former workplace. She's afraid of getting fired but i assured her they would never. I assured her that Walgreens cares about it's employees as much as they care for it. I said as much in an email (i wish i had saved) i sent to Walgreens Corporate. I received a response that is two paragraphs and the second one just basically repeated the first one. My email was polite. I asked for advice. I'm not sure what to do next. My sister is 9 days sober. She chose me as her sponsor instead of her 12 step program. I'm thinking about writing an actual letter but I'm not sure if i should bother.

How do I face the challenge of studying Law and rethinking my professional career?,"A few months ago, due to some problems and, above all, disappointments in the workplace, I have rethought my future and have decided to return to study.

The field in which I want to specialize is Law, because it has been my passion for a long time, but it is not the career I studied in the past when I went to College (Business).

Now I am 33 years old and, although I am aware that it is a goal that will take me years to achieve, I don't want to look back when I turn 40 and think that it could be finishing, that I still have 30 years of working life ahead of me and I never dared.

So this year I will start studying again, while combining it with my full-time job. I want to redefine myself, grow professionally, change my specialty and become a much more desired profile.

How can I organize myself to take better advantage of the study? 

How do I face this challenge? 

What was it like for you to study law? 

What skills should I develop more for the future?

Comfort of living at home hurting my career? (Necessity vs. options),"So I’m 21 and self employed and I have my own goals and have been working towards this the past couple of years. My parents have allowed me to continue to living with them without rent and certain other bills. So I can have less stress and focus on my career.

When I worked at an hourly paying job, I feel like this was great, however now my opinions might have changed.

I have my own goals and everything, but at the end of the day subconsciously I just stop doing the things I should be doing or be lazy because “I know that I’ll still have a place to sleep and nothing will change” 

I’m not sure if that’s the actual reason I’m not being productive or not getting anything done, and I have this immense guilt everyday of not doing what I should be, but nothing changes even if I don’t do it. Maybe just because it feels like there’s no consequences? 

My work ethic has always been amazing, and I’ve been thrown into high positions and been given opportunities I’ve been unqualified for, and those always pressured me into becoming those things or else ____(I’d be fired/id let me team members down/etc)

So do you all think this could be keeping me down? And any suggestions on what I should do? I thought about making my parents charge me rent, but obviously I know subconsciously that if I don’t pay rent, still nothing would change. 

Do I need to move out and feel like there’s actually a consequence? I’ve read a lot about those who have been successful originating from a point where “this HAS to work or else..” and that’s what began the success.

Coworker found out I was gay even though I’m hiding it at work,"I got my friend a job with me a few months ago and I told him that I was keeping it a secret that I’m bisexual. He’s cool with it and said he wouldn’t tell anyone. Today, he came into my office and told me that another coworker said she was being nosy and looked up my name on Facebook & Instagram. She saw my posts (I haven’t actually used either of them for 4+ years) and started telling coworkers about what she found. So it got to my friend where a coworker was asking him “is your friend gay” and of course my friend didn’t confirm anything. And I do acknowledge the importance of having social media private, I just forget about those and didn’t expect someone to essentially stalk me. I’ve made those accounts private and blocked the people so they can’t see anything. Just as a kicker, the only thing that comes up on my profile on Facebook is “Interested in: Women.” Anyway, do I have any recourse? Not sure what to do at work. TL;DR: Coworker is essentially outing me as gay (really I’m bisexual) even though I’m hiding it and I’m not sure what to do at work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/d75b1e/coworker_found_out_i_was_gay_even_though_im/,2019-09-21 03:14:54,agra
[Housing Advice] Hostile Smokers below my Student Room,"Hi Reddit, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

Im a British student studying in the Netherlands. I live in a small town, in a housing with great housemates. I have just moved in. Directly underneath my room there is a small business/shop where the two (sometimes 3) workers smoke all day. Now this is an old house, so the smoke comes through the floorboards! It's disgusting, I sometimes wake to the smell of it lingering, or come home to my room being smokey. I have to keep my windows open all day when they are open, thank goodness we're now coming out of winter. I can't stand the smell, it goes everywhere and sticks to my clothes. The rooms amazing but I can't enjoy it. Let me now tell you a bit more about downstairs.

This is how they describe themselves on their website:

>*""NAME OF BUSINESS is characterized by involvement, advice, service, extensive expertise and the delivery of custom work in which your wishes and interests as a customer come first.*  
*Both companies and individuals know where to find us as a supplier and service point for affordable hardware and a wide range of software solutions.*  
*You have also come to the right place for the purchase of a second-hand computer or laptop, which we supply as standard with a 3-month warranty on the hardware.""*

First of all, the housemates that have been here the longest have their conspiracies about what's really going on in this establishment. They never have any customers, don't do any of the repairs themselves (send it off) and know seemingly nothing about computers. Other than the hint of money laundering, the owner and his wife are extremely hostile and are unwilling to attempt to resolve this matter, even going so far to chase my out of the shop (dudes a giant covered in tats), and threatening to cut our electricity and gas off (even though he has no ability to do this lol). They have no openable windows or ventilation and it's one big hotbox in there.

Additional info: Our student house and the business below is let out by the same Landlord.

I don't know how to deal with these people, but it needs to stop. How do I reason with unreasonable people who dont give a shit about figuratively shitting on my floor. If I cant reason, what steps should I take to stop them?

&#x200B;

Thanks to all who read all of this :)

Edit 1: Thanks for all the reply so far everyone, even if I don't respond to all of them it makes me so happy to see your advice :D

Edit 2: For all you who keep saying I should have known about the smell, or tell me to move etc....not useful advice. There are reasons against these that I am not getting into, so please refrain from telling me the obvious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/fjopch/housing_advice_hostile_smokers_below_my_student/,2020-03-16 17:27:47,tanda
"I am a 20 year old dude, who's struggling to reach out to people. Can I have some advice with making a friend from work","I am just going to give a bit of backstory to start off so you can understand me, my situation, and what the friendships look like.


I was university last year and had a small group of friends of about 5 people, 2 of them actual close friends.  Although when coronavirus hit, I decided to take a gap year because I didn't want to do online;  This being away from school though took a toll on my social life, and by winter 2020, I only had 1 close friend left, but we rarely talked anymore.  This is due to a few things, they got really busy with their premed programs, and I honestly suck at reaching out.  I tend to question whether people want to talk to me, and doubt myself, so it takes a lot of effort to get just a message out.  


I realized I was isolating myself and tried to maintain the friendships, but it was really hard, and I could tell they were losing interest.  Once it felt like I was the only one messaging, I gave up.  If they reached out again I responded, but of course that led me to only maintaining one friendship.  I honestly don't think I am a boring person, I just think my anxiety gets in the way, but I don't know when I should listen to it and ignore it sometimes.


Anyways hopefully you understand me a bit better with that, now heres my current dillema.  I started a new job a few months ago, that has coworkers who are actually my age so I have been having a good time talking to them while at work (I work at a job that enables and pushes to me to be social).  They have opened up to me about personal issues, we have chatted about what we are passionate about, and our goals, etc.  So I am feeling pretty comfortable about talking to them, even though my anxiety definitely makes me stumble on my words sometimes, and I tend to be a little too apologetic.  I really like these people, and want to be more than work friends.


The problem for me is, one of them works their last shift today, when I am not on, and they are the one I really want to be friends with.  I guess a problem I have is I compare how they talk to me and other coworkers, and feel like they get more excited with others by like joking around and stuff, whereas with me they talk more about personal life and the general tone tends to be a bit more serious with a little bit of joking.  I just feel like they may view me as boring or something.  This may all be in my head though, as I have hardcore anxiety.  


Anyways, we have messaged like once before about a café, and that was a couple weeks ago.  That is all we have messaged about and it just feels so awkward to trying to reach out when, I don't know if they actually think of me as a friend, I don't know how busy they are, and I don't want to come off as weird.  I don't know how to start a conversation, do I ask them if they are interested in something I am like music, do I open up just by saying hi?  Would asking them if they wanted to hang out sometime be too much?  


I want to start any sort of conversation with this person, I just so worried about how they will react.  Will I weird them out?  Is my anxiety a red flag for others?  Is it too soon to message them?  I have no clue what I should do.  


So the advice I want is, should I try being friends with them, and how would you go about reaching out.  I am sorry if this is really vague or awkwardly worded, please ask questions if you need to understand better.  I just hope I can get any bit of advice.

I desperately need help deciding what to do with my life,"I am feeling somewhat miserable right now, mainly because there are so many things I want in life, and it seems like they are always out of reach.

I am primarily interested in science (I am a biology PhD student) and writing fantasy fiction, but I am never sure which one I want to control my life. 

I am fairly certain I want to be a fantasy author, but I don't even know if that's possible. I've never had a large enough block of time to truly devote to the craft, and even though I write pretty well when I do write, I don't know how to accomplish my goal. There does not seem to be a modern way to just give yourself over to creativity, as you need money for everything.

In terms of the science, I've always wanted to be a biologist, but I am seeing more and more that careers in science are 90% paperwork and bureaucracy and frustration. It's so frustrating to be unable to do things because of all the barriers. I don't know if I could do it.

Something I might want to do is open a bookstore, as I know a lot about books and know people who could help me with the logistics of opening a bookstore. I think it would help me have something important to help me pay the bills while I try seriously writing. 

Does anyone have any wisdom on how to go about deciding and planning? It's so difficult to see ahead sometimes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/l83oab/i_desperately_need_help_deciding_what_to_do_with/,2021-01-29 20:45:19,goa

Help! A doctor in my hometown was kidnapped by the police and tortured.,"Well, here goes nothing, I hope this gets at least some visibility so doctors outside of Mexico find out what it's like to work here. I'm afraid it'll be a long post since I couldn't find any news in English, I'll link to a source in Spanish at the end if someone would like to read it first-hand. 

Dr Azucena Calvillo works with critically ill COVID patients at the ICU in a public hospital in Durango, México; last Friday she left her job at around 8:30pm and her family lost track of her. Local medical colleges started sharing her data and a picture in case anyone saw her or knew anything regarding her whereabouts. Later that same day we found out she had been taken by the local authority; they put her in a safe house and tortured her, then she was imprisoned without a trial.

Medical Colleges now nationwide started raising their voices and she was released and thankfully is now home; however, she's still being charged with attempted murder, at least she's not in jail anymore... 

They're accusing her of trying to murder a magistrate who was under her care in the ICU under mechanical ventilation, suffering from severe COVID-19. The prosecutor's office claims she came into the hospital outside her work hours and tried to shut off the man's ventilator, but the alarm went off and she ran away. We're talking about a 34 year old female internist who's been battling this disease for more than 9 months, putting herself and her family at risk, with a spotless record. 

They claim to have video evidence of her leaving the room, and her car being in the parking lot at that time; however all you can see in the video is someone clad from head to toe in PPE, impossible to even determine with full certainty that it's a female. Off this evidence she was taken without a warrant into police custody, due to legal reasons they've yet to reveal how exactly she was physically tortured, but what we know for sure is they threatened to kill her, her husband who is a nurse working in the same hospital and her daughter if she didn't sign a confession, or if she dared speak about what happened.

Why her? No clue, apparently she had a recent argument with the magistrate's sister who's also State Delegate of Tamaulipas Social Security Institute (IMSS), basically a very influential person. Apparently that was her mistake, antagonising someone powerful.

So that's basically it, I tried to keep it as short as possible, if you want more details or you can read Spanish here's a [link to the story](https://elpais.com/mexico/2020-12-09/el-caso-de-la-doctora-acusada-de-intento-de-homicidio-contra-un-magistrado-con-covid-acumula-interrogantes.html)

Hope this gets some visibility, because it's a terrible situation.

Edit: Sorry, not health secretary, was a mixup on my part she's IMSS' delegate

Edit 2: UPDATE: All charges have been dropped, but now it seems no one is responsible, so the colleges are still pushing for consequences for those involved in the kidnapping; it's all real shady, but at least now she is not at risk of losing her freedom again. Thank you everyone for your support and your interest in the matter. Apparently protests will continue, I'll keep you all updated

"Testimony of a surgeon working in Bergamo, in the heart of Italy's coronavirus outbreak","«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.

Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).

I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.

The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.

Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.

I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.

The cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.

Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.

Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

Typical day in the COVID unit,"A lot of people have been asking me what it's like being on the COVID wards in the hospital, so I figured I'd share what a typical day looks like for me:

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Pharma gave me. Softly weep as it doesn’t put a dent in my medical school loans

6:30am - Make breakfast, using only foods from the diet that gives me everlasting life by avoiding all fats, sugars, carbs, and proteins. For details buy my book and check out my shop.

7am - Get to work, load up my syringes with coronavirus before rounds.

8am - See my patients for the day. Administer the medications that the government tells me to. Covertly rub essential oils on the ones I want to get better.

9:30am - Call Bill Gates to check how 5G tower construction is going, hoping for more coronavirus soon. He tells me they’re delayed due to repairs on the towers used to spread the Black Plague. Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.

10am - One patient tells me he knows “the truth” about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. He’ll never conspire against me again.

11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. John’s wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors. 

12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year. 

1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.

2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows “the truth” about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.

2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow.

4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize I’ve mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tiger’s Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure

6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading “the truth”

6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about “the truth” is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk. 

7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.

9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York,"Day 4

“The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.”

I’ll start off with what is good.

We’re becoming more adept at treating COVID cases. With a growing census of confirmed COVID positive patients (10 COVID positive in a census of 16 today), we’re getting a better sense of how this bastard virus behaves. There are the easy presentations: 40F w/ no significant PMH presenting w/ a 7 day hx of fever, dry cough, fatigue found to have bilateral ground glass infiltrates, elevated LFTs, lymphocytopenia and even fucking hypokalemia on admission. Might as well not even swab to confirm. (But the ED will, oh yes, because now they’re swabbing everyone and costing us probably 30-40 PPE kits per admission while we wait the 24 hours for the COVID test to result.)

But then there was the subtle one: 73M w/ multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed with simple CHF exacerbation and sepsis secondary to a UTI (positive UA and UCx) who was tubed on arrival to the ED, admitted straight to the ICU, found to be COVID negative 3/21. He is taken off the vent within 24 hours and discharged to the floors. Because he’s COVID negative you see. We treat him with antibiotics, work up his NSTEMI which he managed to throw in during his first day admitted and kind of take mild interest in his recurrent fevers. But he’s not coughing and is satting well.

Yesterday, my team and I thought “This guy has a normal white count, elevated LFTs and recurrent fevers. Forget the last test, order a repeat COVID.” I do this several hours before speaking with the attending physician. During table rounds, he pointedly asked me if I was aware of the protocols the Command Center had put in place for repeat testing. I say no, as these protocols change every day. (Side note: N95s are now rated for indefinite use, not just 4 days. Hope we didn’t toss all those other ones away for no reason!) “Cancel the test, let’s get Infectious Disease on board and ask them their input.”

I put in for the ID consult, I... ""forget"" to cancel the COVID repeat or inform the Command Center. Busy day as you saw from yesterday. Comes back positive. *We know what this bastard virus looks like.*

But we spent 2-3 days in his room without our N95s on.

We would have spent more in there had we not tested.

We’re still early, but we know how fast or how slow a case progresses. Our younger patients, the 41F and the 49M might get discharged to home quarantine as early as tomorrow! They’re not reliant on supplemental oxygen and haven’t had fevers for >24 hours. Our older patients aren’t as lucky. No one on our census so far has been intubated. The 73M whose COVID we caught late rapidly progressed to requiring supplemental oxygen and was transferred to the SICU as the last stop before ventilator land.

We’re getting better as a team of residents. We’re all more than a little scared. I’ve talked to my favorite resident / current carpool buddy / best second-in-command about my anxiety about this situation. How the adrenaline kicks in when I’m on the floors and makes me feel less afraid and more focused. The crash after work is awful and the anxiety kicking back in takes a drink or two to knock down, but fuck it, I’m better at my work when I’m not terrified.

Oh and the food remains the best part of the day. Thank you, local places that sent great sandwiches for lunch and Greek for dinner. Makes the rest of this easier to write about.

Now on to what’s not good.

The hospital is now greater than 2/3rds COVID cases. The ratio of ventilators for COVID patients to non-COVID patients is 7:1.

We’re maxed out on the capacity of our Intensivists, intensivist PAs, and Anesthesiologists. The sprawl of the traditional ICU has taken over essentially anything that used to be elevated care and we’re still scrambling for beds. A handful of Internal and Family Med Hospitalists are being recruited to act as lieutenant Intensivists overseeing the ventilated. I mean lieutenant in its original definition: ""substitute,” “deputy,"" literally ""place holder."" They report to the Intensivists directly.

At lunch today, it was declared that due to the sheer number of Rapid Responses and Codes, and due to the overwhelming census of the Greater ICU, Residents responding to Rapid Responses are not expected to get any Intensivist backup.

I’m no stranger to Rapid Responses. You hear the call over the PA and are given a floor, you rush upstairs and enter a room blind with someone either choking, or unconscious, or bleeding, or seizing, or with a heart rate incompatible with life. You remain calm, you ask the patient questions while asking the nurses to give a summary of the patient’s medical background, current admission issues, latest changes, vitals, labs, imaging. Scary, but doable.

During the meeting, the Medical Director said the Hospitalists would be asked to run Code Blues. The Hospitalists balked.

See, Intensivists ran *every single Code Blue* in the hospital before now. One Hospitalist said, “We haven’t run a Code since residency! The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.” The room of a couple dozen full-blown-attending Hospitalists nodded in agreement. I was the only resident there, too stunned to speak up. No final decision was made.

I know the timing of Epi pushes and ACLS algorithms enough that a couple days’ review would cement it pretty well. But the actual pressure of making the call for a defibrillation or a push of atropine or adenosine is so beyond what I’m emotionally prepared for.

CPR is a violent, ugly thing with a fatality rate that is 100% for COVID patients with lungs too full of fluid for their heart pumping to matter. Even if I were to run everything perfectly, the person is still going to die. Let alone if I make the wrong call.

I’ve come to terms with the idea that I’m going to see COVID patients die under my care *a whole fucking lot.*

I don’t want to be forced to watch them die under my care from three feet away while I make a series of life or death decisions that are guaranteed to be utterly pointless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 5

“If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE”

“Usually takes about 20 minutes, then everyone’s arms get tired”

If this hospital is at war, it’s ceding territory at an alarming rate.

Here’s the layout of the field: we’ve got medsurg wings on the cardinal points of the compass (except 2SW for some reason) in a somewhat random pattern from first floor to fifth: 1N, 2S, 2SW, 3N, 3E, 5E, 5S. The ICU, CCU, CICU, and SICU are floating around the periphery of the 3rd floor.

By the time I started Day 1, 2SW and 5E were already on lockdown and designated as COVID territory. My team alone had a total of two pending and one confirmed COVID cases.

By Day 2, the CICU became a conflict zone and joined 2S and 5E. 5 COVIDS or pendings.

By Day 3, my team had pending tests in 5S as well. 6 COVIDs or pendings.

By Day 4, the 5th and 2nd floors were entirely given over to COVID. 3E still had some non-COVID evacuees waiting to be transferred to the last bastions of 1N and 3N. Everything ending with -CU is overrun by this point.

It’s Day 5. My census stands at 15, of which 9 are COVID positive. There’s talk of clearing out 1N sooner or later even.

The hospital is fairing less well: of the 170 or so inpatients (not counting the 25 or so Greater ICU COVID positive people on vents), 100 are COVID positive, and a third more have pending tests.

…

So those are the numbers. Actually walking the halls puts the change from Day 1 to Day 5 in starker contrast.

The amount of PPE used per nurse or CNA has steadily increased. On any floor (except the Last Bastion wings), if you squint your eyes all you can see is uniform green paper scrubs with blue hairnets and and blue paper booties and blue paper masks +/- an N95 underneath. If you look further down the hall you’ll see a spray of yellow as one of them gowns up to enter a patient’s room. (The nurses have been using Sharpies to write their names on the paper gowns so people can tell each other apart.)

Maybe you’ll spot a Resident in a long white coat rush by.

And by every single door on wheeled tables usually topped with hospital food are boxes and boxes of blue gloves and yellow gowns. Might be my imagination, but the boxes of face masks are disconcertingly not as ubiquitous.

The Greater ICU is less colorful. Just window after window of people on vents. Walk the whole length of it and count maybe one person who’s conscious. Most don’t look like our usual ICU clientele of the cachectic elderly. These are mostly men (my imagination?) ranging from their 50-70s.

I made the mistake of asking who the youngest intubated COVID patient on the unit was.

Younger than me.

So we finish at the ED. It’s not chaotic like a Saturday night. Sure there are a few beds in the hallways, but that’s nothing new. I walked the length of it too. Some people on oxygen here and there, wider variety of ages.

Lots of people getting gowned up to enter rooms though. And I know we’re supposed to take them off at the door of the patient’s room, why are people walking around-

“HEY! If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE. With an N95 on!”

The ED is now considered COVID home territory.

…

I don’t feel like a soldier. I don’t feel brave for showing up to my job. I most certainly don’t feel like a hero.

I feel like the tide came in way too fast and now I'm staring at waves from below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 6

“There’s another Anesthesia Stat. Don’t know where we’re gonna put that one.”

55M with PMH of uncontrolled DM2, HTN, CKD3. Admitted 5 days ago for fever, SoB, dry cough, you get it. COVID positive on Day 1. Went to a COVID medsurg floor, experienced worsening hypoxia on NC, and started on nonrebreather. By Day 5, transferred to the newest territory grab of the Greater ICU, the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit - the PACU. We’re not doing surgeries anymore, so no anesthesia, so that’s free real estate to park the intubated.

One other thing. The PACU was never meant for anything longer than a few hours’ stay and has only drapes between beds. No doors or walls means this is COVID home turf. You have to completely PPE up to even enter the unit.

This newest long walk of ventilated COVID patients is kept alive by 2nd string equipment. No modern touch screens, no real time graphs, just an aged-beige box with some dials and digital-clock-red settings. It does the same job - you can set the PEEP, FiO2, RR, AC/PSV just as precisely as the modern machines.

Even the third tier stuff never intended to serve as ventilation for the 10-14 days of ventilation COVID patients may require works well. These are the surgical ventilators the anesthesiologists used to use back when we did surgeries. They have been liberated to serve the Greater ICU. We’ve even drafted the ad hoc ventilators of the local community of outpatient docs to act as reserves.

Code Blue called on the 55M gentleman above. The team rushes up and I am deeply relieved that it’s not a Code I have to run. By the time we get our PPE on (takes about 3 minutes), he’s already being intubated. No chest compressions required. We put in some orders, we watch the Veteran Attendings tube their first patient of the day. It is only about 8AM.

”Anesthesia Stat to the ED” heard on the overhead PA means someone is getting intubated essentially right after they enter the door. The Intensivist sighs and wonders out loud where they’re going to place this next patient on a vent.

The Greater ICU is quickly becoming The Empire of the ICU as more unused departments get swallowed up by the need to house the intubated.

...

I try to comfort myself with knowing I'm still living in the *good* days, relatively speaking.

No one on the hospital staff is sick. No one on my team or Residency program is sick. I'm not sick. We still have beds and ventilators, at least for the time being.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York (#11-13),"Day 11

“…unless it’s ’visibly soiled.’ Like we could *see* Corona.”

&#x200B;

I’ve been known to flirt with the LD50 of caffeine, but this morning I’m slipping it some tongue.

I’m status post two pieces of 100mg caffeine gum and a cup of coffee by 6:30AM. I hit 70 on the back roads heading towards the hospital in the minutes just after sunrise. There are practically no other cars around. My AirPods stream Andrew W.K.’s “Ready to Die.” A tasteless choice, sure, but it fits the energy of the day so far.

The 73M with multiple comorbidities who developed an NSTEMI, and who tested positive for COVID 4 days after testing negative has steadily been declining in the SICU. He’s refusing his medications despite his seasoned ICU nurse using the full spectrum of asking, demanding, and sternly admonishing him on his nonadherence. She even broke out the fake tears, she told me. She doesn’t do that for everyone. But no dice.

More importantly he’s doing poorly on a nonrebreather (NRB). If he takes the mask off, his sats drop to the 70s, a value you might guess correctly to be incompatible with life. He’s a little altered and he’s been put on dilaudid and a wrist restraint. Just the one, a CVA left the left arm safely useless.

One of the interns asks me what the plan was for our patient here.

“Palliative has a Goals of Care meeting with his family today. Our only plan is to keep him alive long enough for them to sign the DNI/DNR.”

I can blame the caffeine, I can justify it by saying his prognosis was *dire* and it’s reasonable to think we did all we could, but I scare myself a little with how low my empathy’s dimmer switch is set.

But I don’t know how else to deal with this. The recommended treatment guidelines changed, yet again. Azithromycin is now actively *counter*\-indicted for COVID patients. We take him off it. Steroids, which as of yesterday were counter-indicated for COVID are now the standard of treatment for all patients on NRB. We start him on Solu-Medrol 1.5mg/kg divided BID. For all the good that will do.

He’s also well past the 5 days of Plaquenil / hydroxychloroquine. You know, that drug that was supposed to solve this whole crisis?

We all remember that right? I’ve got photographic proof we used to believe it would work.

Take a look at the March 17th (or Day -5, if you’d like) *National Enquirer* cover:

>**CORONAVIRUS**  
**CURES**  
**FINALLY**  
**FOUND!**  
>  
>*Warning! Surgical masks* ***SPREAD INFECTION!***

Take a look at *every single intubated patient’s* medical orders and you’ll see they either completed or are on Plaquenil and azithromycin.

And people *still* think we have any handle on this other than jamming tubes down throats and waiting.

No one will believe the history of this thing when it’s over.

The patient passed that afternoon.

His daughters had signed a DNI/DNR right before.

…

I’m reminded of an intro Stephen King wrote for one of his books, where he writes about fear:

>*""The shape is there, and most of us come to realize what it is sooner or later: it is the shape of a body under a sheet. All our fears add up to one great fear, all our fears are part of that great fear - an arm, a leg, a finger, an ear. We're afraid of the body under the sheet. It's our body.…And \[the writer\] takes your hand and he enfolds it in his own and he takes you into the room and he puts your hands on the shape under the sheet… and he tells you to touch it here… here… and* here\*…""\*

A quarter million Americans (*at least*) are going to become bodies under sheets in the span of one or two months. And we’re talking about returning to work and a “miracle” ending to this in nine days.

Wake up and feel the corpses.

*^((PS: Yes, I owe Stephen King a royalty check given how much I crib his writing style.))*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 12

“I will continue using military metaphors. We are at war with this virus.”

&#x200B;

The greetings this morning were grim.

“Stay safe” has become the *aloha* of intra-Resident conversations. I heard that twice before reaching the front doors of the hospital by 6:50AM.

“How was the night?” is the standard greeting to the two Residents just finishing their 12 hour Night Float shift. These are the two young MDs left to put out fires across half the hospital’s two hundred or so non-ICU beds.

“We had the longest Code ever. Took an hour. We went through maybe 20 epi’s.”

Epinephrine is only given to people with either pulseless electrical activity or those who are asystolic – flatliners. (Once again, Hollywood has lied to you. You don’t put the paddles on anyone with a monitor next to them going **BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP**.) The ACLS guidelines say you push epi every 3-5 minutes.

The *Ok, We Tried* alarm should have gone off about 3-4 epi’s in. Not 20.

“Was it a young guy?” “No, It was John.”

I curse a little louder than I mean to. I walk out of the room and wash my hands even though I’m sure I hadn’t touched anything.

John is- *was* a nurse at my hospital. He *was* maybe in his early 50s. Every Resident loved him because he was tough and always fought for his patients. He was a nice guy and a pleasure to work with. But he was fierce. He’d seek us out during Rounds, stare us down and make sure we put in orders for his patients ASAP. We all respected him.

I knew he was on a vent as of the night before with settings that looked, well, *dire*, but it’s still a shock.

The night team leaves. I start mindlessly updating the cheat sheet summary of our 16 patients. I’m on autopilot at this point. 13 are COVID cases. COVID cases are, unfortunately, very easy to manage. You put in orders for medications that you’re pretty sure don’t work, you note how bad their oxygen saturation is on nasal cannula (NC) or nonrebreather (NRB), and you gown up and see the worst cases / people you think might need to be intubated in the near future.

The first Rapid Response comes at 7:40AM. I reach the door (of course it’s a COVID room, that’s all we have left) and realize I left my N95 at home. I’m not entering that room. I flippantly tell the interns to assess the situation and head to pick up a new mask at the Command Center.

The nice nursing admin lady hands me a paper bag with a new N95. She tells me to sign for it in the binder just outside the door. Despite my autopilot brain, I joke, “Oh we’re on the honor system? You know I’m just going to sign ‘John Smith’ in the binder right?” She laughs and says it’s ok I left my N95 at home.

I take my mask and sign John Smith in the binder.

Just because I’m in shock doesn’t mean I can pass up a joke like that.

I head back up to the Rapid. I get a debrief that this was narrow complex ventricular tachycardia in the 200s. They pushed metoprolol (wrong decision) and adenosine (right decision). I go talk to the very bright and hardworking intern on my team. I explain that in situations like this where the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable, metoprolol isn’t going to do enough to slow the heart rate. You’ve got to reset the circuit breaker. I asked who the attending was in the room.

There was no attending. The intern had to make the call.

I left my interns to the wolves when I walked off in a huff to go get a new mask.

My autopilot brain goes over how shitty I am of a senior Resident. *When YOU were an intern, at least your seniors never walked away from a Rapid.*

As I walk back to the call room to barricade myself behind a door for an hour or so, I come upon a nurses meeting where the news of John’s passing was being announced. I honestly don’t remember a single word of it. I do remember the occasional sobs coming from these amazing women.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

Table Rounds.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

I’m getting good at assessing whether or not a hypoxic COVID patient will get tubed and if we have time to get them upstairs before they crash.

Go me.

…

*“The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.”*

I worry that some of my fellow Residents will break in the near-future.

It wouldn’t be a big break, just a small one that makes you sob on the way to work and dread every new day. For what it’s worth, so long as no one in the residency program gets sick, I don’t think I’ll break. A few of us are close though.

It‘s the Night Float’s birthday today. Which means she technically coded John for 60 minutes on her birthday in the pre-dawn hours. When she tells me this, we tell social distancing to go fuck itself and hug for a while. I offer to take her shift and work a 24, but she declines.

The possibility, the *comfort* of breaking feels like it’s hiding just over the horizon waiting for us.

It’s what follows that Hemmingway quote which worries me.

*“But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”*

John never broke.

He was good, and gentle and brave. And he was killed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 13

“Where do you want dad to die? Paralyzed on a ventilator or not?”

&#x200B;

Quiet day. Got time to take stock of everything.

The hospital is housing somewhere around 250 patients including the regular floors and the Empire of the ICU, >90% positive COVID. My team’s census for tomorrow is 100% COVID. There’s talk about transferring the few remaining COVID-negatives to the USNS Comfort.

Oh, and yesterday some moron tried to crash a train into the USNC Mercy on the West coast. Because we’re dumb, panicky animals.

45 COVID cases on vents with a dozen or so vents available. A little over 60 people currently on nonrebreathers.

We're still 5 days from peak hospitalizations and 6 days from peak fatalities per day.

Personally, I think I’m holding up as well as I can. Writing has helped. Occasionally get some exercise in. Plan on going for a long walk tonight.

I’ve got 6 more days of scheduled inpatient care left. Two weeks of vacation after that. I’m thinking about signing up to do COVID swabbing since it pays well and I’d go nuts if I weren’t doing something.

I still hate the idea of treating this as a war, but I’m thinking about volunteering to be “redeployed” to another hospital elsewhere in the States once New York gets past this. The rest of the country is only a week or so behind. New fronts are opening up. I’m pretty well experienced in managing COVID cases at this point.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York (#14-16),"Day 14

“Alright we’re done.”

&#x200B;

I wonder when we’ll need a refrigerated corpse truck trailer.

Before my shift officially starts, at 6:50AM, a Code Blue is called. 90F w/ dementia and probably a long list of other comorbidities is found essentially cold and dead when the day shift nurse first walks in the room at the beginning of her shift.

Because mankind is cruel and irrational, this lady whose last real conscious thought occurred several years to a decade ago is still Full Code. So half a dozen nurses and four doctors all gown up and rush into her room to break her ribs before she's officially pronounced dead.

Because we're doing *everything to save her*, don't you see.

I swear to Christ I'm not this heartless when I'm the outpatient Family Med doctor I was supposed to be.

By the time I find a gown (a lovely, blue plastic trash bag of a gown which makes me sweat profusely and leaves my back slick with sweat and my gloves full of sweat and I pray we get those breathable yellow paper gowns again) then put on my eye protection and gloves and enter the room, the attending is already calling it quits.

The anesthesiologist asks if this patient (*this corpse*) needs intubation.

“If you want to intubate her that’s fine. If you want to put yourself through it.”

One push of epi.

There's no blood pressure, pulse was gone well before we got to work.

Time of death… who knows.

Does it matter?

…

I come back to my call room and look at the census. 22 patients, 100% COVID.

I scroll a third the way down the cheat sheet and see EXPIRED. At this point that just means alerting the attending of more paperwork to be done.

I round on all my patients. They're all miserable, can't catch their breath and have headaches. A very nice lady asks that if she and her husband are in the hospital, should her 90 year old mother who lives with them be afraid? The truth is if you flip a coin she's already infected. If she's symptomatic and needs to go to the hospital, she's got a good 1 in 5 chance of dying.

I neglect to tell her those odds. I tell my patient to call her mom, and that she should report any symptoms to her regular PCP.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

He was a younger guy, only in his 60s. He's got a chance.

Then table rounds.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID… isn't intubated.

88M w/ dementia plus many other things. He'd never make it off the tube.

We're here now. We're running low on beds and ventilators and the Tough Decisions are being made.

The ~~guidelines~~ the dictates of the Gods of the Empire of the ICU as of a few days ago were a patient could only be intubated if they were A) satting <90%, B) tachypneic >30RR, and C) prone when these were taken.

Now we're adding on if they've lived a life well into their 80s or if they've got dementia or if through ""clinical judgement"" you know they're hosed, then they won't be tubed.

It makes total sense.

I've had a few calls now where I've gone through the pre-written script for letting the typical patient's spouse of decades and decades know their world is about to end. How that soul they've nuzzled up against for comfort is close to depart since death is inevitable.

""Not a candidate for invasive intervention"" is the exact phrase.

Rationing? Cold calculation in an unprecedented time of suffering?

Truthfully, I'm thankful I’m not making these decisions.

Day 16

“Basically they wanted me to lie to the family. Say ‘we did everything we could.’ But we didn’t.”

&#x200B;

This is when things start getting bad.

Did I feel it when I walked in today? The shift in the air?

One of our patients, a lady in her 80s, has been steadily degrading, gasping for air on a nonrebreather for close to two weeks. Palliative was brought on board yesterday.

Palliative calls the patient’s husband. It’s documented right there in the chart: “Pt has living will expressing no aggressive measures including CPR and Intubation however her husband appointed HCP does not want to place limits. Call placed to pt's husband for follow up. He is unwilling to talk further than ‘I want my wife home.’”

Overnight, the patient remained febrile, 102.7F despite Tylenol and cold packs. Hypotensive, 50/20s. Agonal breathing. It’s a sight you won’t forget after you’ve seen it. The clinical definition is disturbing enough: *“…characterized by gasping, labored breathing, accompanied by strange vocalizations and myoclonus.”* ICU evaluates her and says she’s not a candidate for pressers, intubation, or CPR. But still, no DNI/DNR order is placed.

The Night Float calls the patient’s husband. He remains adamant that he “wants everything done.” Night Float is essentially told by the Emissary of the ICU to not even enter the room should she Code, then call up the husband and reassure him we tried our best.

There’s a piece of me that empathizes with the patient’s husband. He’s been married to her for who knows how long. He was probably terrified, in denial, and isolated.

But a bigger piece of me thinks he’s a *fucking monster* for extending his wife’s suffering explicitly against her prior wishes.

At 09:19, we get a call that she has stopped breathing. Code Blue goes off.

The nurse at the door says something about how she knows it’s futile but she didn’t feel right not calling the Code. Because FULL CODE and DOING EVERYTHING TO SAVE THEM is sacred. Or it was. Or something. I don’t know anymore.

I tell everyone the plan. “Two people and two people only in the room.” I point at my interns. “Stay outside.”

I put on my gown and gloves. Did I put on the stylish lab glasses I wear around my collar as an apocalyptic-chic fashion statement? No, I remember now. I kept my regular glasses on instead. Because a good 30 seconds into breaking this woman’s ribs someone else entered the room and put a plastic shield over my face.

But before that I asked for a backboard under the patient. She was wide eyed and dead but I still asked for it.

And before that I pointed at the clock and said, “In five minutes, at 9:26, we’re stopping the Code.”

I’m pretty sure I felt ribs pop in succession like a zipper when I started compressions.

I think it was only two or three minutes into the Code before the intensivist walked into the room. He asked the patient’s age (82) and if she had dementia (she did) and after learning so told us to stop immediately.

Time of death… who knows.

Does it matter?

…

I leave the room without making eye contact with anyone. I try to remain cognizant of my hands and the right way to take off my PPE without buying a metaphorical scratcher ticket for the slight chance of intubation or death.

My poker face must suck because I’m asked three times in a walk of 300 feet if I’m ok. (Not even poker face. It’s all covered with a mask. My eyes are giving me away.) A nurse, the Chief Medical Officer of the entire hospital, and the Medical Director of the entire hospital. They all ask if I’m ok. I’m not, but I lie.

I tell the truth to my patients and I lie to my colleagues and bosses.

The nurse who called the Code in the first place asks me if I’m ok as I’m walking out of (fleeing from) the unit. “Thank you, doctor. Thank you.” I can’t summon any words to respond. *Thank me for what?* is the only thought I have.

The Chief Medical Officer stops me and asks me if I’m ok tells me we’re going to have a meeting sometime today to discuss end of life issues.

The Medical Director asks me if I’m ok and sees right through me. He does his best to boost my morale.

He knows I’m a big fan of the food being offered to the Heroes of the Hospital (*I assure you I bitterly laughed while writing that*) and insists I go get some food. I half-heartedly say I had a piece of a donated heart-shaped Danish earlier, but he goes out of his way to physically walk me over to the Command Center where some breakfast burritos were delivered.

I appreciate this gesture so much. I’m just a little ashamed he had to spend time on me when he’s dealing with quite literal life and death decisions on an hourly basis.

I soft coded a patient and got a breakfast burrito for the trouble.

Go me.

*I soft coded a patient.*

I was protecting my team and the nurses and it didn’t matter if we put on pacer pads not or if we even tried epi and she was dead when I walked in the room.

"Essay from Josh Lerner, MD after the CDC loosens guidelines for all of us on the front lines","
“In one of the most vivid scenes in the HBO miniseries ""Chernobyl"" (among many vivid scenes), soldiers dressed in leather smocks ran out into radioactive areas to literally shovel radioactive material out of harm's way. Horrifically under-protected, they suited up anyway. In another scene, soldiers fashioned genital protection from scrap metal out of desperation while being sent to other hazardous areas.

Please don't tell me that in the richest country in the world in the 21st century, I'm supposed to work in a fictionalized Soviet-era disaster zone and fashion my own face mask out of cloth because other Americans hoard supplies for personal use and so-called leaders sit around in meetings hearing themselves talk. I ran to a bedside the other day to intubate a crashing, likely COVID, patient. Two respiratory therapists and two nurses were already at the bedside. That's 5 N95s masks, 5 gowns, 5 face shields and 10 gloves for one patient at one time. I saw probably 15-20 patients that shift, if we are going to start rationing supplies, what percentage should I wear precautions for?

Make no mistake, the CDC is loosening these guidelines because our country is not prepared. Loosening guidelines increases healthcare workers' risk but the decision is done to allow us to keep working, not to keep us safe. It is done for the public benefit - so I can continue to work no matter the personal cost to me or my family (and my healthcare family). Sending healthcare workers to the front line asking them to cover their face with a bandana is akin to sending a soldier to the front line in a t-shirt and flip flops.

I don't want talk. I don't want assurances. I want action. I want boxes of N95s piling up, donated from the people who hoarded them. I want non-clinical administrators in the hospital lining up in the ER asking if they can stock shelves to make sure that when I need to rush into a room, the drawer of PPE equipment I open isn't empty. I want them showing up in the ER asking ""how can I help"" instead of offering shallow ""plans"" conceived by someone who has spent far too long in an ivory tower and not long enough in the trenches. Maybe they should actually step foot in the trenches.

I want billion-dollar companies like 3M halting all production of any product that isn't PPE to focus on PPE manufacturing. I want a company like Amazon, with its logistics mastery (it can drop a package to your door less than 24 hours after ordering it), halting its 2-day delivery of 12 reams of toilet paper to whoever is willing to pay the most in order to help get the available PPE supply distributed fast and efficiently in a manner that gets the necessary materials to my brothers and sisters in arms who need them.

I want Proctor and Gamble, and the makers of other soaps and detergents, stepping up too. We need detergent to clean scrubs, hospital linens and gowns. We need disinfecting wipes to clean desk and computer surfaces. What about plastics manufacturers? Plastic gowns aren't some high-tech device, they are long shirts/smocks...made out of plastic. Get on it. Face shields are just clear plastic. Nitrile gloves? Yeah, they are pretty much just gloves...made from something that isn't apparently Latex. Let's go. Money talks in this country. Executive millionaires, why don't you spend a few bucks to buy back some of these masks from the hoarders, and drop them off at the nearest hospital.

I love biotechnology and research but we need to divert viral culture media for COVID testing and research. We need biotechnology manufacturing ready and able to ramp up if and when treatments or vaccines are developed. Our Botox supply isn't critical, but our antibiotic supply is. We need to be able to make more plastic ET tubes, not more silicon breast implants.

Let's see all that. Then we can all talk about how we played our part in this fight. Netflix and chill is not enough while my family, friends and colleagues are out there fighting. Our country won two world wars because the entire country mobilized. We out-produced and we out-manufactured while our soldiers out-fought the enemy. We need to do that again because make no mistake, we are at war, healthcare workers are your soldiers, and the war has just begun.”

Anonymous writings of a covid nurse,"“You a nurse?”

I glance up from my phone and look at the young man before me, dressed in a rumpled blue Kroger apron and khakis. He’s maybe seventeen, possibly a little older. It’s hard to tell these days with everybody wearing a mask. We’re left to judge those around us based on their eyes and build alone. The enthusiastic, carefree manner with which he’d been jabbering at the bagger next to him before he turned his attention to me gives him away far more than what I could glean from his appearance.

“I am,” I answer. I’m coming straight from work, still dressed in my navy blue jumpsuit and the classic black departmentally-approved jacket that has my name and hospital logo emblazoned on the chest. I’m hungry, exhausted, and sore. I just spent thirteen hours getting my ass kicked in full PPE. There’s *at least* a stage two pressure ulcer behind my ears that stings perpetually, serving as a constant reminder of the year we’re living through. On a normal day, I’d probably enjoy this little social back and forth. On a normal day, I’d love meaningless pleasantries like chit-chatting about my job. But right now, I’m just looking to score some stale fried chicken from the freshly closed hotline before I sink wordlessly into a scalding bath with a glass of wine.

His eyes light up. I can almost sense it coming.

“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen?”

I might feel offended if there was anything left in me capable of feeling. It’s a rude enough question to ask in its own right, but it’s especially awful timing during 2020. My colleagues and I are in the middle of a war. Or maybe it’s a genocide. Somedays it feels like the unending tide of patients will never stop, mounting higher and higher until the collective crush of humanity finally stresses us to our breaking points. Mothers, fathers, grandparents, uncles, daughters. They fill our beds up regardless of whoever they are to whoever brought them in. And yet the rest of the world keeps on spinning merrily along, intentionally oblivious. Throwing birthday parties, traveling to the beach, celebrating 12th anniversaries over steaks and bloomin’ onions at Outback.

What actually *is* the worst thing I’ve ever seen, I wonder? Despite the numerous times I’ve fielded this query, I’ve never truly stopped to think about it before. A number of situations spring to mind immediately, but they’re all oddly blurry through the lens of distant recollection. I can’t picture faces. I can’t remember names. Truth is, this young kid in front of me might have been on my assignment yesterday for all that I know. Once the time clock gives its telltale chirp that my badge swipe has been registered, I dump everything in my locker and leave…including memories. It’s just the nature of the gig. Very few individuals ever sneak their way into my synaptic clefts and set up permanent residence.

But today? Today is different.

This is one of the shifts that’s made a rare impression on me, like pushing your thumb into a memory foam mattress. I’m left with a little divot in my psyche. Even now, standing before the plexiglass barrier in this dumpy Kroger with the lackluster produce section, I can mentally feel that little hollow and know that somebody has moved in. No vacancies today, I’m afraid.

I had a full line of folks today, but only one of them was riding my nerves. Old guy. Not that it matters in my opinion. Nobody deserves to die like that regardless of age. Covid, of course. What else is there to treat these days?

He’d picked it up from his daughter, I guess. Contact tracing is mostly an exercise in futility at this stage. It doesn’t matter, anyway. The moment I laid eyes on him at shift change I knew that he was a dead man. It was written all over him in a language that every single healthcare worker is fluent in. The head-bob with every inspiration. The way his collarbones and ribs became prominent as he gulped for breath like a man drowning in nothing. The faint sound of crackles, like cellophane being crushed between your fingers. The restless picking at his covers, his gown, his oxygen mask, clawing them all off with whatever strength he could muster. For whatever reason, most people prefer to exit the world they way they entered it; clothed in nothing, helpless to the elements.

I replaced his oxygen mask and ignored the blaring saturation alarm desperately attempting to alert me to the fact that he was in danger. He was already on 100% oxygen. He’d long since finished his round of remdesivir and convalescent plasma, for all the good they’re worth. Short of forcing pure O2 into his lungs with a pressurized noninvasive ventilation system, there was nothing else to be done. He’d never tolerate a BiPap anyway. He’d have it yanked off in a New York minute and I’d be left scrambling in the hallway to get geared up and put it back on before he coded. If his family wanted him to be full care, I was going to have to tie his arms to his bed. Even then, it was blatantly apparent that he wasn’t going to survive. He would die alone, fighting in restraints, suffocating slowly until his light was snuffed out by a strand of RNA a mere 70 nanometers in diameter.

I paged his attending and told him that it was time for The Talk. You know the one. The one where we admit defeat. Throw in the towel. The one where we switch gears from healing somebody to ensuring that they’re dying well. “Okay,” he replied with a sigh. “I’ll give them a call. Watch for orders and you’ll know which way it went.”

It didn’t go the way I expected, but it did go the way I hoped. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw orders for morphine, ativan, and discontinuation of telemetry monitoring instead of serial ABGs, BiPap settings, and a stat chest xray. His futile fight was over. He would be allowed to exit stage left with a set of unbroken ribs, no tube expertly placed by a far-too practiced hand into his throat and threaded down until it reached his ruined lungs.

He finally went unresponsive and entered the actively dying phase about halfway through my shift, but I had the tools at my disposal to keep him comfortable. I pointed a fan straight at his face and turned it on high in the hopes that his brain would mistake the wind for breath. When he became air hungry, I had medications in my arsenal to keep him satiated. When he became anxious like a cornered animal, I had the tools to keep him calm. I turned the lights low. I brought in an LED candle and placed it on his bedside table. I pulled a chair next to him, held his hand, called his family and asked them what kind of music he liked to listen to. Old country, came the answer. Even though it was an exposure risk for me, I pulled out my phone and put my Spotify Premium account to good use. He won’t die alone, I promised them. I’ll be here. They thanked me for my kindness, my care, my compassion. They feel better knowing he’s in my hands, they say.

If only they knew that what *I* feel is nothing.

That's not a normal human reaction. It’s monstrous. *I’m* monstrous.

Who watches somebody die horrifically, far away from the people who love them, residing under every single isolation precaution we’ve ever developed a protocol for and has no emotional reaction at all? Who numbly performs empathetic actions solely out of the formulaic knowledge that it's the socially correct thing to do? What kind of nurse operates like this, anyway? We’re supposed to be the shining pillar of solicitude. We wrote the book on warmth and care. But, whatever a good nurse is supposed to be, I’m the antithesis of it now.

I'm an android masquerading as a normal person. I'm the Borg. A Geth unit. I feel like a computer crunching numbers on a spreadsheet, only the numbers are other creatures and I'm pretending to feel alive like them. Most days I’m thankful for the masks more for the physical distance it places between me and other people than the physical protection from illness. At least they can’t tell that what I’m demonstrating isn’t noble stoicism, but numbness.

Maybe this is self defensive. Maybe it's a trauma response. Maybe it'll all come back to me in a flood one day when this is all over and it'll bring me to my knees. Or maybe I'm just fundamentally broken as a person by everything I’ve witnessed this year. Maybe this is permanent.

I do recall that I used to feel. I used to cry with my patients when they received bad news, or genuinely cheer with them when they received good results. I used to celebrate every discharge as a small victorious moment in their lives and my career. I wasn’t always like this. I regret that I’m like this now, and yet I don’t know if I would change it even if I had the ability to do so.

I watched a man die today and felt nothing. And *that*, I think, is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.

But this kid doesn’t actually want to hear that. He doesn’t want to know the real stuff. He wants to be regaled with a glory tale. A story about how I once coded somebody and they farted with every chest compression. A quippy anecdote about some guy that “fell” on a cucumber that somehow mysteriously ended up in his rectal vault. It’s socially inappropriate to be honest and I don’t really care to be honest anyway. So I pause for a second before deciding what to say.

“Eloesser flap care,” I reply. “Had to pack a guy’s chest cavity twice a day with 26 yards of gauze. Every time I pulled the packing out it was like that old magic trick with scarves.”

He grimaces and laughs as his mask slips below his nose. He doesn’t bother to replace it. I don’t bother to remind him, because it changes nothing anyway. He has no perspective on what it’s like inside the halls of my hospital. He’s young and careless, even though he’s taken seventeen thousand selfies of himself in a mask to prove how conscious he is to Instagram. It’s just his nose anyway. Even if he gets it he’ll be fine, he thinks. And most likely, he’s correct.

It’s the nurse in front of him that isn’t fine.

Rough Day,"Edit: thank you all for your supportive words 🙏 I posted here with no particular expectation, but you all have had such kind things to say. I know others have had it worse than I have, but I am so grateful this community exists for me today and for others past and present who need a little pick-me-up and validation. I'll pay it forward whenever I can with myself and my colleagues.

Hey all. Wasn't sure where to post this, but /r/medicine seemed the most appropriate.

I'm a new anesthesiologist at a community hospital. We have not been crushed by COVID yet, but we're moving in that direction, and every day we're teetering on the precipice of at or beyond capacity. The policy in our shop is to have anesthesia do all COVID intubations if at all possible and there haven't been a ton of them to do so far, but we had a somewhat unexpected bolus today and I had a handful. Now, I'm usually pretty unflappable and can take a lot of stuff--I think a lot of us are, or were, before COVID--but one of the patients today really hit me hard.

He's an 80 year old with multiple comorbidities who's been steadily declining on increasing non-invasive ventilatory support. The ICU called us somewhat non-emergently understanding that the patient was definitely heading that direction. I go over there with a CRNA for extra hands, we PPE up, and start the preparations. The ICU doc is in there with us and does the procedural time out while we're setting up, but before we can get started the patient gestures around his hissing BiPAP for something to write with. He tries to say what he wants to say a couple of times, but the BiPAP is too loud and he just can't muster enough air to speak up over it. There's a bit of a scramble for pen and paper, and he just starts writing what we think are random words. One of the nurses pipes up and says, ""I think those are song names"", and the patient nods. Then he writes ""funeral"".

He was desperately scribbling the songs he wanted played at his funeral. He knew that he is likely to get worse, and that he may die--he explicitly told the ICU to keep him on the vent no more than a week, and told his family to hold them to it. He knew that this could be the last time his eyes close.

Then we intubated him and lined him up and went on to do the next one.

I don't think there is a way we go ""back to normal"" after all of this. There will simply be before COVID and after COVID.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/kxih8a/rough_day/,2021-01-15 00:11:26,morbi

Day 18 “You’re trying to save the world and I’m trying to save you.”

Premeditated. That's the word I'm worried about.

75M w/PMH of CVA, nonverbal, bed bound, resident of a NH. Presented w/ fever of 103F, found to be COVID positive. He was doing well this morning, only on 2L via NC.

While responding to a different patient's Rapid, my intern is called off to assess this guy. By 14:00 he was satting in the 80s. Started on NRB. She orders a CXR and a ABG. I return from the Rapid (60F w/ alcoholic pancreatitis, COVID negative, hypoxic, watched her get tubed) and take a look at the patient. Junky lungs on auscultation. Agonal breathing. Clearly. Despite the NRB and sats in the upper 90s, the guy looks scary. Scary enough that I think he's going to crash in the next 10 minutes or so.

He's Full Code, of course. Before he had been transferred to our service, Palliative had already been consulted. After a few days of unsuccessfully trying to contact the patient's only living relative (his daughter), she signed off on the case. No Goals of Care meeting for this man.

I don't want to Code him. I don't want my nurses or I needlessly exposed to a droplet bomb of a resuscitation that I know for certain the ICU would never accept. He won't get tubed, and if he's not getting tubed he's dead. He's dead regardless of whatever we try.

""Full Code, COVID positive. Probably going to have to do chest compressions."" ""Yeah. Limit the people in the room. Five minutes on the clock."" ""Then we'll call it.""

I didn't hesitate when I said that.

It wasn't a spur of the moment decision. I have thought over the previous Code and my decision then to limit it. And I'm repeating it.

God help me.

It doesn't sit right with me so I go to the medical director of the hospital (the very nice gentleman who got me a breakfast burrito, as you remember). I present the case.

""This is a big ethical dilemma."" He exhales with the same exacerbation I feel. He offers the choices of treatment as usual (CPR / maybe intubation) or possibly two attending doctors attesting could sign off that CPR/intubation would be pointless. He tells me to see the CMO.

I go to the Chief Medical Officer. I repeat the story. He's a good man, a pediatrician by trade. Used to do our 8AM peds didactics. He's on the ethics board. He chews over the ethics of the case for a while.

As much as the conversation about end of life was enlightening, I'll spare you the filibustering.

The CMO meets up with my team (fuck, I never meant for this to escalate like this). He again filibusters the ethics of the case. Ultimately, he chooses to write a note as an Ethics Consultation advising that if two physicians are in agreement, a DNI/DNR order can independently be made.

After he leaves, my attending: ""Once you make someone DNR yourself it's a civil case, but it can be a criminal case against you.""

We all agree that he has no chance of surviving the Code, and even if he magically made it to a vent he'd die from respiratory failure. Or the kidney failure. Or maybe heart failure.

The other attending, my program's inpatient director for the hospital and ""Physician of the Year"" also balks at signing the form. Because he's not involved in the case, you see.

My attending says he'll talk to the ICU attending to maybe get a signature.

""Don't call it a soft code. Never say the words 'soft code.' But…""

I won't write the rest of what he said because I respect the man too much.

I am fighting uphill to do the right thing. Or what I think is the right thing. I don't know anymore.

...

Before I leave for the night, I text my attending asking if he signed the DNI/DNR. He replies ""No. It’s a tough decision.""

As I'm walking out I tell the nurse handing off this patient to the night shift that he is still full Code. She's incredulous. She had put out that bright pink MOLST form right in front of the attending to make sure it was signed two hours ago.

""Why didn't he sign it?""

""Because he's a moral coward.""

…

I come home, watch *Westworld*, call up my best friend and weep.

Not the pretty tears of a Hollywood doctor overcome with their episode's brush with mortality who goes on to eloquently explain their sorrow.

No. It was ugly, wordless, choking crying.

Not for anything in particular. I couldn't say why today was the day I broke a little. Maybe a lot.

The only words I remember saying are ""*They all keep dying*.""

Day 19 The Story of Me

The absolute arrogance of you.

You thought you knew this thing. This *fucking monster*. And yeah, you caught and exposed one case. You could probably catch every case from 100 yards out at this point from just basic labs and an O2 sat even without a COVID test.

But you had no clue early on that this was EVERYWHERE. That this would spread so quickly and would overwhelm the census this thoroughly. The ED was right to start testing everyone who entered the doors and it wound up protecting you and your team.

And you denigrated them for ordering those tests. Day 4, it's there in black and white. And now your census is 100% COVID even if they came in for a fall. You wrote that on the same day as you proclaimed your mastery of this plague. Idiot.

You can manage the cases on the floor and order all the meds that whatever today's recommended shotgun approach to management has advised. You can know each and every single COVID patient's SpO2 and if they're NC or NRB by heart and it doesn't matter.

The monster causes DVTs even in patients on blood thinners. How many people did you admit that were placed on SCDs instead of heparin or Lovenox because their clotting score was essentially nil? How many people on Lovenox still threw clots? How many did you discharge home two weeks ago without a 30 day prescription for Lovenox? How many of them are going to die?

And the sudden deaths. You didn't notice a pattern in all those Code Blues? How pretty much all of them were PEAs? You coded a guy on the fucking floor because he dropped dead walking to the bathroom. How many did you send home are going to drop dead from *that*?

You advocated for a man to not receive CPR or be tubed like everyone else. *What do you possibly think gives you the right?* All you did was piss off your attending. Nothing changed. The patient will still end up getting Coded.

Every other doctor in the hospital is ok with pointless interventions, so why aren't you?

*You're not doing well*. And you want to forego one or two weeks of scheduled vacation to go volunteer for more of this suffering?

Your mentor got sick, and you could be sick. You already suspect you're an asymptomatic carrier like every other Resident.

Why stick with this?

The absolute arrogance of you.

…

But don't forget the good parts.

Don't forget going to an impromptu party you just had next door with your fellow residents.

Don't forget drinking Coronas and laughing with your friends.

Don't forget commiserating with them over this catastrophe.

Don't forget being open and honest with your interns and knowing they don't think you're an asshole.

Maybe you're doing a good job.

You can't get that Starfleet Medical tattoo on your left deltoid in Brooklyn right now like you wanted, but you will eventually. And getting a permanent reminder of those three red lines of split skin on your left 5th digit knuckle from washing your hands constantly would be a nice memento of this shitshow.

The eyebrow gash you got from that botched piggyback ride last night is pretty funny though.

Hugs and kisses,

"“Ok ok ok ok ok, one, two, three, four now PUUUUUUUUUUSH”","As all funny stories about residency begin, it started in the Intensive Care Unit.

I’m a recently promoted second year Family Med resident who’s earned the privilege of becoming an ICU orders-bitch.

Most of the job is a mix of data-entry and the equivalent of optimizing floral designs in a funeral home on fire. I mop up the charts, correct sodium and magnesium and potassium and phosphate levels on future corpses and immobilize and anesthetize the rest.

“Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his restraints renewed before this afternoon.” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his pain meds renewed.” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his diet orders advanced.” “Mrs \_\_\_ ’s NG tube needs an order.”

I loathe this rotation with every part of me.

I’m working a 24. Friday to Saturday, 7AM to 7AM.

The first twelve hours aren’t so bad.

The usual morning of catching up on a baker’s dozen critically ill patients’ charts, talking to the badass ICU nurses who tolerate residents like myself well enough despite our stunning ignorance.

Were I two floors below and two weeks past this hell of a month, I’d be a normal second year, PGY-2 sophomore lieutenant guru for the Interns on the inpatient teaching service.

Were I two floors below and not isolated from my friends, my job description would comprise of *Know the census, check in on the trainwrecks, maybe expedite a discharge summary if the kids are running late.*

Here I’m the idiot with a couple letters after his name trying to gain the favor of the Biggest ~~Pricks~~ Men on Campus who you go running to when the patient has the audacity to try to die on you despite your best protracted efforts.

So it’s still morning and I’ve set up camp on the furthest left terminal on the lazily curving row of desk space facing the 20 or so ICU sliding glass aquariums of the rapidly dying and essentially already dead. Ventilators, drips, and tubes galore of Frankenstein medicine buying time for some, prolonging suffering for more, and maybe, *possibly* saving the life of one.

As a doctor who normally communicates with the living, you cannot imagine how annoyed I am.

The day proceeds as normal these last three God-forsaken weeks: Look up and notice the intensivist has already begun rounding without so much as tapping me on the shoulder because it’s beneath him to acknowledge me directly.

We see the rest of the patients. There’s about 15 full minutes of teaching mostly punctuated with “…which you should look up” the way old telegraphs were punctuated with STOP. He says we’ll do an IJ later today. I decline the opportunity to personally take a scalpel to an octogenarian’s neck.

No one dies during the daylight hours. No discharges or downgrades either.

…

Night shift.

19:00, the overnight nurses come on and my next twelve hours get more interesting.

The wisdom of modern medicine has decreed that when treating the most fragile and complicated patients, the best person to take the helm from dusk to dawn is a second year resident running on equally lethal amounts of caffeine and dread. So I’m thrown the keys to the ward and now run the show.

Time to pay attention.

The census: your run-of-the-mill hyponatremia, a few multi-organ failures w/PMH of the everything with a management goal of, “Convince the son/daughter Mom’s dying this week,” and the remaining ones trying to take me with them.

The problem makers:

65M w/PMH of EtOH abuse, paroxysmal Afib, DM2, HLD, gout, found to have hyponatremia in the one-teens. Alcoholics are easy enough to take care of. Put them on CIWA protocol, squirt Ativan into their veins every so often, we’re cool. He’s only flipped out and saw a baby crawl up the wall once today and subsequently got well and truly snowed. We’ll be fine.

87F w/PMH of stage 4 breast ca w/ mets to lungs, GI tract, and brain, presenting w/ AMS. Hospital course significant for sepsis and multi organ failure requiring ICU stay w/ central line and HD. Basically a grandma with cancer of the everything, dead before she went through the sliding glass doors after it got too hard to breathe at home, but she’s still full Code.

I had a 30 minute discussion thirteen hours earlier about her prognosis with a series of family members handing off the cell phone from one to the next about continuing this futility of care. Bright pink MOLST form still went unchanged for this half of the shift.

63M w/PMH of schizoaffective disorder, HTN, HLD, came in with AMS and found to have a CMP which competed for “most number of values incompatible with life” seen by the hospital. H&P significant for a diet consisting entirely of *Chobani® Greek Yogurt - With Fruit On The Bottom* (blueberry, for the record) for the last three or five years.

Earlier in the day I got pimped on this patient regarding Refeeding Syndrome by the scowling, perpetually mildly perturbed Intensivist. I failed spectacularly and retreated to my furthest-left terminal to sulk while reading UpToDate.

And beyond how terrifying managing the few-groups-shy-of-a-balanced-food-pyramid case is, I’m also on the clock to catch a kid tonight.

Continuity delivery. She’s crowning at 2AM and I’m contractually obligated to catch her kid one floor down in the maternity ward.

…

27F G3P2 w/ no significant PMH about to pop. She’s one sprinting floor down the stairs. I’d been getting progress texts all night: station and dilation and effacement all now pointing towards *if you want credit to graduate, get down here immediately.*

There’s a rule in my Family Medicine program that in order to become an independent, grown up doctor, one must catch exactly five (5) or more kids whose mom the Resident has seen at least three (3) times for routine prenatal care.

I had seen Ms \_\_\_ well above three times for prenatal care and would not be denied my trophy.

Saw Mom since her first *you’re-sure-I’m-pregnant?* clinic visit. Was there the first time we picked up the kid’s heartbeat on the Doppler.

I’ll trade however much they pay to do a colonoscopy or a cath just to keep being around a happy mom’s experience listening to her next new kid’s first heard heartbeats.

The tocodynamometer’s peaks confirm the texts and I take note at the wails of this suffering, sweating goddess who’s now both parts future of humanity and possible minor surgical emergency.

My physician’s mind calmly regards my patient’s genitals leaking blood and shit and a baby’s crowning skull as something equivalent to an art piece recreation of the War In Vietnam and I assure you I don’t freak the fuck out at all.

Unrelated, most of my time before this was spent on checkups of healthy third graders or managing hypertension in otherwise healthy adults.

The Family Medicine Intern on overnight Obstetrics, Dr \_\_\_\_ and I stand shoulder to shoulder at the business end of a uterus so we can get both get credit for catching this kid. No time for booties for me, I’m lucky to have had the handful of seconds to put on a mask and splatter-resistant gown.

The L&D nurses and the Midwife play overenthusiastic cheerleaders at the crest of each contraction wave.

To be honest, they’re doing the majority of the work.

“***Push push push push push push*** annnnnnd **BREATHE!**”

They hold her hands, they help fight her agony.

Then, a miracle occurs.

…

I’ve been told this is one of the happiest moments of your life.

The culmination of so much worry, and want, and love on a level no one understands until they see the face of their first child the first time.

For me, Mom’s blood is puddling against my black Chucks and I’m dreading playing tug of rope with the afterbirth then shakily stitching Mom’s perineum / boink bridge flesh wound back together.

Labor for a Resident is so much more than just catching the kid.

Still work to be done even after the small triumph of not fumbling a newborn’s head onto the tile despite having zero training on playing quarterback to a hiked football covered in lube.

Labor stages have a second half after you’d think the shift should be done.

*Stage 3 of 4: After the baby is born, you continue to have contractions so that the placenta can be born.*

*Stage 4 of 4: The two hours after birth when breastfeeding can be established. Contractions continue as the uterus will shrink.*

I clamp off the umbilical cord twice a couple inches apart but neglect to milk the center of the tissue outwards.

Professional OB/GYNs, please don’t spoil the ending.

I create the anatomical equivalent of a pressurized blood balloon. Which I then proceed to cut, sharp end of the scissors directly anatomically inferior to my face.

A miniaturized Bellagio fountain spray of cortical blood unleashes upward, making a splattered streak of red from my right cheek to my glasses to my forehead to an already-red single curl of my hair to the fucking *ceiling*.

None of that is a lie, none of that is an exaggeration.

The cleaning crew had to replace a ceiling tile after my handywork.

The L&D nurses got a good laugh that pre-dawn.

I’m too punch drunk from lack of sleep to do anything but laugh along and think *of course*.

…

I take the stairs double step back up to the ICU.

I taper off the adrenaline rush for an hour checking in on my ICU patients’ charts. Everyone is still alive, no reports of toddlers tapdancing on the ceiling, Cancer of the Everything’s still breathing, Chobani’s labs are looking better. I crash in an unused ICU bed in the furthest possible left-most side of the unit.

Smells like plain hospital detergent and hospital plastic, feels like scratchy hospital linen and a flat hospital pillow. For all I care, might as well be like slipping into a warm hotel bed with a fiancé.

I’m vaguely aware of the electric bed inflating at odd places from time to time to save me from bed sores.

I awake to my phone’s alarm exactly one hour and seventeen minutes later for morning sign out.

"“Put your white coat on, look the part for this call.”","It’s night. Because it mostly happens at night for whatever reason.

Quieter at night, maybe. More somber, more empty. Would feel out of place to leave the room after and see sunrays through the glass.

You haven’t taken a call like this before. It’s ok, don’t apologize for waking me up to help you through it.

The simulations in med school were brief and more an intro acting class than anything. But I’ve taken these calls more than a few times. Just a few too many times lately, come to think of it.

Remember we’re participating in a ceremony, a very important ceremony. It’s essential we put on our vestments. Naked black scrubs and a lopsided stethoscope around your shoulders might be appropriate for the rest of the patients you’re madly dashing around managing. But let’s take our time for this call, even if it means taking ten minutes ignoring your cell as it gets hammered by pleas for 3AM stool softeners, sleep aids, and the occasional potential heart attack which 98% of the time is GERD or transient stable angina.

Our appearance is meaningless to the patient now, but very important to the family.

You ever been an altar server? Doesn’t matter. That’s about the only real training I had, other than on-the-job opportunities. I don’t mean the times I served *those* Masses, I mean being in front of an audience and serving as a symbol rather than a technician.

We’re participating in a sacrament. *An outward sign of inward grace.* It’s important that we show grace for these next few minutes. Because there’s only the smallest mote of diagnosis in these next minutes, but our actions will decide whether we become spite-worthy phantoms or mere background characters in this family’s memories.

Put on some gloves. Non-COVID, thank Christ, so we can at least keep the rest of our humanity bare despite the mask.

Let’s enter the room. I’ll make the introductions and perform the ceremony. All you need to do is watch.

Try to tune down the quiet sobs.

Not all the way, just don’t succumb to sobs yourself.

Use your most gentle voice. Look everyone in the eye, left to right, person by person as you speak.

“I’m sorry to interrupt you all. I’m Dr \_\_\_\_\_\_, this is Dr \_\_\_\_\_\_. We’re here to check on David, we’ve been told he’s passed.”

Use his first name, it shows one last shred of empathy despite the Very Important Initials after our names.

Because the next part becomes legal and lifeless.

*1 §1. \[Determination of Death.\] An individual who has sustain*   
*2 either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory*  
*3 functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions*  
*4 of the entire brain, including the brain stem, are dead. A*  
*5 determination of death must be made in accordance with*  
*6 accepted medical standards.*

In your softest voice, shake him (gently, please, this is theatre) by the shoulder and ask.

“David? David? David?”

He won’t wake up, but it’s important that you tried for the audience.

Now take your knuckles and rub them against his sternum. Hard. You’re actually checking for a response now, so you need to lay into it. You’re trying to cause pain to reveal life.

I won’t dwell on that last line.

But still, no dice. He won’t wake up, so now we get to cross our t’s and dot our i’s and whatever idioms no longer exist since we all type our words out in EMRs.

Listen to his non-beating heart with your lopsided stethoscope. Take your time, at least a minute. Ignore the five calls waiting for you, this is an important moment.

*If this is a corpsicle fished from a frozen river, you can’t pronounce them dead until they’re warm and dead, but you already knew that.*

*It’s funny what our medically-tuned brains focus on, isn’t it?*

Listen to lungs that breathed the same air as you 24 hours earlier and try not to feel small in their cathedral silence.

Look him in the eyes. This first time you’ll fight against it, subconsciously tear your gaze away to anywhere else, even towards the gaping open-jaw drama-mask frown, instead of those lifeless windows to an absconded soul. Take out your phone and turn on the flashlight and shine it into the stationary panes to confirm no one’s home.

Make note of the time of death. That goes into the record, you know.

“I’m sorry, but David passed.”

Sigh here. Just don’t cry. The rest of the family will take care of that for you.

“Thank you for being with him. He was very lucky to have loved ones near him when he passed.”

The pronouncement means *nothing*. Having initials after your name and blessing the dead and blessing the family who bore witness to this death means *everything* for this call.

*That* was why you were called.

The nurse told you the patient died when you answered the phone, and you will never second guess it because you know she’s competent and also it’s incredibly obvious what a corpse looks like after a 1 second glance for 99.99% of the cases.

We flash the initials after our name and wear the long white coat and sport the stethoscope and *this is what we do*.

We pronounce the dead.

…

I don’t know if there’s an inherent finite end to empathy.

Does the sparking fuse eventually run out and detonate leaving some wreckage of *mere* sympathy? Or does it lead to something far, far worse? *Gomers* and utter stoicism to suffering and death like *way* too many of the top elite of the hospital?

I only worry because when I’m alone with a patient who died, I go through the motions and I sincerely feel sorry for their passing, but at the end think: *By the power vested in me by this great state and nation I hereby pronounce you, dead.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/hl6vb3/put_your_white_coat_on_look_the_part_for_this_call/,2020-07-04 17:14:52,tanda
Are we tolerating the status quo too much? [Serious},"In today's medical culture, are we undervaluing physicians by tolerating the status quo?  The status quo of rising medical school costs, poor mental health, mistreatment in residency, broken technologies, inflated administrative costs, etc?...  We limit medical student postgraduate options to internship and residency, yet we graduate NPs and PAs to begin supervised practice with a starting average salary of $105,000.^([1,2](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/nnQn+Rhob))  Meanwhile, medical students graduate  unable to practice medicine without an internship (that pays an average starting salary of $56K.)^([3](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/DW0u)) I'm not arguing against physician extenders or residency. **I'm arguing against the status quo in medicine.** 

To be licensed as a physician in most states, you must complete a year-long internship.^([4](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/GKZv)) California is requiring multiple years of post-graduate training.^([5](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/KWbu))  Our status quo provides no in-between licensure options for medical students, while we are simultaneously graduating NPs and PAs into supervised practice. In 26 states, NPs can practice autonomously in their field immediately.^([6](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/g0nU))  Why are physicians that graduate from a US medical school and cannot match into a residency (for whatever reason) less able to practice medicine than NPs and PAs?  Is it just the status quo? 

Right now, of the medical student graduates who do not go to residency, some become scribes, MAs, and consultants. ^([7](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/1zpK)) Very few find research jobs, and even fewer gain a temporary license that allows them to practice at the level of a mid-level under the supervision of a physician like you can in Missouri.^([8](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/JJ9P))  So what are you, the physician, to do?  The Flexner report of 1910 gave us the gold standard of medical training for the time,^([9](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/qNBL)) yet we act like no future improvements are needed today.^([10](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/6v56)) 

If you're like me, you have some changes in mind.  I can list several improvements I'd like to see.  First, rising school costs are trapping students.^([11,12](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/zFeu+P40u)) Medical school graduates have, on average, $251,600 in debt these days.^([13](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/ggr7)) The debt doesn't disappear, either, for those who cannot match into a residency.  Medical schools are increasing tuition annually and federal loans accrue interest from the beginning.^([14](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/P50Q)) Why do we allow interest to begin accruing so many years before employment is possible, and why do we pay so little?      

Medical schools should aim to produce autonomous physicians, but not every graduate can achieve an internship.  What are they supposed to do? Physicians should create a ""supervision-required"" midlevel-style license for medical school graduates that haven't completed an intern year.  Otherwise, less painful routes to the top of medicine will continue to gain steam. Administrators need to fill gaps in their hospital systems with providers from somewhere, after all.  

We have a physician shortage, despite an increasing number of medical schools and residencies.^([15](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/fgme))^-([16](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/f8ym))  In fact, the total number of residencies available has increased at the same rate as medical school enrollment.^([17](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/FMlm)) However, in 2019 there were still 44,603 students competing for 35,185 PGY-1 spots.^([18](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/u0o7))  You have a huge discrepancy between PCPs and subspecialists, so applicants are unevenly applying to the higher-paying fields.  Also, IMGs are applying for US residency positions. 

Then there is the status quo of mental health crises among trainees and other physicians. Still, physicians and students commit a substantial number of suicides every year.^([19–23](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/MMMm+XOXG+2G4w+VDdC+9f6k)) That's not a fun fact. Perhaps you're like me and have known someone to take their own life.  Medical training and practice are toxic because of the high stakes.  There are board exams used as gatekeepers to certain competitive specialties.  You are often sleep-deprived and stressed. Not to mention, if you are careless then someone dies (no pressure). Also, healthcare costs are skyrocketing due largely to administrative expansion.^([24](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/bwu3))  Overall, there are fewer and fewer resources for physicians to utilize.^([25](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/HShL)) It's a tough environment right now.  We have to buck the status quo.

**You can** fix the illogical things we are doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing quality. Where to start?  Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses.  It just takes some common sense, optimism, and compromise. It takes all of us.

**Physicians need to get more active in politics.** Policymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement by you, the physicians. For example, we have 1,100+ EHR vendors, in 2020, that cannot communicate data between each other.  That is the status quo.  However, if forced to do it, I argue EHRs could share data.  How?  If policymakers mandated some standard changes to the requirements for all EHRs.  We would need to mandate the creation of a unique identifier that all healthcare providers use to find common patients, a mapping between coding languages, and a system to distribute stored data storage between systems.^([26–28](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/LV9u+oIpW+20oA))

**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to remember your leadership roles** in the hospital, the community, and beyond to seek progress.  Physicians need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen.  If we can do that, we don't have to worry about anything. The problem is, there are very few physicians with enough of a spine to stand up to the status quo.  Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked.   **You're not alone.**  We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  It's got to be the *physicians*.  


The status quo has got to go.  **How will you stand up to it?**

Most things are not seizures,"I'm finding that, more and more, ""seizure"" is becoming a catch-all term for literally any clinical phenomenon. Patients may be walking, talking, syncopal, actively having an MI, or all of the above - it's all considered seizure if it looks odd enough. In fact, just mentioning key words like ""shaking"" or ""seizure"" is often enough to prompt a neurology consult. Since seizures are a painfully heterogeneous phenomenon, this is not entirely unreasonable. But at the same time - and this should go without saying - most things are not seizures. Lately, some of the things that have raised concern for seizures have been a bit troubling. I feel like a bit of a jerk when I use terms like ""neurophobia,"" but... well, see below.    


A few weeks ago, I got a rather breathless call from one of the newer nurses in the ED, asking me to come help with a patient who simply would not stop seizing or fighting with staff (1). Not unkindly, I suggested that usually people are only able to do one of those things at a time. From what I could hear in the background, it sounded like a pitched battle at the moment, the sort of situation required Haldol + security, rather than Dilantin + me. But I knew this nurse; he's really nice, and he wouldn't have called unless he felt as if he had too. He also fell into that camp that believes that people generally operate by certain rules, and neurology is meant to explain all aberrations (2).     


Still, it was early in the week, when you're still filled with the sort of free-floating good will that pushed you towards medicine in the first place. So like a saint gearing up to sling alms, I holstered my tuning fork and trundled over to the ED, where I was greeted by the sight of a tall, skinny gargoyle of a man in a hospital gown. He was covered in old tattoos and scratches of varying age, with dried blood sheeting down the side of his head. I could see the tendons in his hands as he clutched the the doorway of his ED room and screamed at staff. Occasionally, he would point people out individually with one accusing finger, and you could see white in all 360 of the degrees around his pupils. Being off to the side just a little, I could also see the bright, quarter moon of his butt cheek as he informed the ED physician that ""I know you, motherfucker.(3)"" I sighed. A little crowd had gathered, maintaining a sensible 10ft radius, and they all watched these proceedings with the sort of ghastly expectation usually reserved for Japanese dating shows and Nascar races. I considered quietly moonwalking back the way I came - but then I saw why they had called me over.    


Mid-paragraph, he stopped. His teeth clenched and the cords of his neck stood out as he arched his head and neck back. He clenched his fists in front of him and looked very briefly like Bruce Lee warming up for a match. I had just realized that he was holding his breath when he squatted down to a half-crouch, his arms started to shake and his head rolled back - but he remained upright. I'm sure that, for the bystanders, it was very dramatic. To me, he looked like Bruce Banner forcing a BM and accidentally turning into the Hulk.   


The nurse that had called me started to ask for more ativan, and I told him to hold it for now. I'd read the chart beforehand: this man had already had enough benzos to fell a rhino in heat; his serum seemed to be 30% gin; his UDS was a Whitman-esque celebration of recreational substances. Overhearing me, the ED resident nodded wisely and started to call for Versed and Dilantin instead. I waved that off too, with a sort of growing desperation. Were we all seeing the same thing?    

Before somebody could talk themselves into administering a propofol drip with extreme prejudice, I walked over with my hands held up, as if to show that I was unarmed. I asked the patient, - still mid-squat, mind you - if he was doing alright, which was a ridiculous question. But he did look at my face mid-""seizure,"" which was more or less the point. I suggested we hang it up for a little bit and talk in his room, to which he snapped ""This ain't my room, shit head. My room is the streets. (4)""    


I glanced over his shoulder as if seeing the room for the first time. ""Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely the streets,"" I agreed. I've found that for these cases - cases with a high likelihood of ending in a scrum followed by 6 months of prophylactic anti-retrovirals - the best approach is to channel the serenity and bafflement of the cow as he crosses the intersection. So, we began to chat. He sat on the edge of (not) his bed while I asked stupid questions and checked stupid reflexes.    


I can't say that I remember our conversation verbatim, but I do remember certain exchanges.    


>Me: *(points to Saving Private Ryan-esque head wound)* ""What happened to your head there?""


>Him: ""How should I know?""


>Me: ""Well, do you remember what happened before, maybe? Did you fall? Were you in a fight? Did you wake up like that?""


>Him: ""Did you wake up like a *bitch*?""    

And...


>Me: ""Have you ever had seizures before?""


>Him: ""Everyone has seizures sometime, man.""


>Me: ""I don't know about that, but, um, have you ever been on seizure medications before?""


>Him: *(looking at me scathingly)* ""No. I don't wanna get addicted to that shit.""    

Also...

>Me: ""Is there anyone I can call? Maybe someone that was with you, might be able to say what happened?""


>Him: ""Goddamn sand n-gger, you tryin' to call Kevin? You tryin' to call **Kevin**?!""    


He kept repeating this last, louder and louder, as he stood up (5). For my own part, I backed out of the room, just as un-heroic as they come. And dear reader, I shit you not: as I back-pedaled, I heard another nurse warn everyone that ""Here comes another seizure!"" Why, if I hadn't been fleeing like a coward, I'd have had no words.    

The patient came out right after me, his hands tearing at his hospital gown. In a blink, he had it off and wadded up into a loose ball, which he fired past my head at the nursing station. He stood there, naked and heaving, covered in bizarre tattoos - lots of faded blue dice on his forearms, harlequin masks, sundry big boobed devils on motorcycles, etc. But, more specifically and terrifyingly, he had a tattoo of a wolf howling, drawn *en face* in faded blue ink with orange eyes - and it was tattooed on his crotch in such a way that his penis seemed to emerge from its mouth.    


This, I found, was my absolute limit. The bad consult I could handle. The swearing, insults and racism I could chalk up to hard living and neuro-chemical extremis. But the wolf? That had taken time and *forethought*. It was clearly the watermark of a personality that would take any AED's I started and return them to me rectally, before stealing my car keys. Security swarmed in, and I walked out.    


As I did, I passed the hospitalist he was being admitted to, and she asked me if I would be ordering an MRI, Keppra, any of that.    


I sighed again. ""No, He's got PNES, chronic crazy and essential racism. Let's start with a head CT and an EEG, if we can get them.""    


""But he's still seizing,"" she replied, looking at the anarchy over my shoulder. I looked back to see him hulking out again, as no less than three burly rent-a-cops tried to bulldoze him back into his room. Blessedly, the crowd of bodies kept me from finding out if he had an erection.    


""I don't think that's a seizure,"" I said, trying not to sound appalled.    


""Yes, he's seizing. I see it,"" she replied, and she actually pointed, as if that would clear things up for me. As if she hadn't been clear enough, or perhaps in case I'd gotten confused and examined the clothed, 82yo woman one room over.    


""Please don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think a seizure is what you think it is,"" I said, before shimmering out.

1) I don't get called to the ED very much, and that's by design. We actually have a few separate neurology teams. If there's a patient that needs to be dipped in rTPA, the stroke team comes running. If somebody woke up with a couple of burst pipes, the neuro ICU is standing by with soft voices and warm hands. If somebody is having seizures, or anything resembling one, the ED orders a Hellfire strike of benzos with one hand, while putting in a non-urgent consult for ""prolonged post-ictal state"" with the other. Given all of these heroes - who are likely doing kettlebell swings or one-armed pullups while waiting for the Commissioner to blaze the signal - there's really only a sliver of niche emergencies that would require someone like me. This was not one of those cases.    

2) I tend to feel that the practice of neurology adheres to certain principles, while humanity - the species that yielded both Ska and Suge Knight - is a heaving mass of carbon and wild-eyed outliers, screaming into a void.    

3) He did, as it turned out. They'd met during his last visit to the ED, during which he'd threatened to beat up the little old lady in the room next to him before leaving AMA. So, you know, believe your patient.    

4) While he could have said it more nicely, he wasn't wrong. Besides, seizure aborted, right? I take my wins wherever and however I can.    

5) I am demonstrably non-white, but didn't seem to be what disturbed him most. If you can categorize things like this, I would say that he was being more collaterally than primarily racist. He seemed more focused on my possibly getting in touch with Kevin. I never found out much about Kevin, but it's hard to imagine that they shared a cubicle wall at the NAACP.

Edit: 

Thank you so much for the gold(s)! There have been some concerns, and so I'd like to clarify a few things: 

-I'm not trying to make fun of people with epilepsy, or those with PNES (or those with both). I'm simply trying to point out the tremendous amount of misunderstanding surrounding epileptic seizures. Hopefully while being funny. Obviously, your mileage may vary.

-I didn't simply stop treating this guy. I did try to figure out if he had epilepsy, which had led to him injuring himself. It was hard, because he was really difficult to deal with. I wasn't able to amass any evidence that he had epilepsy. 

-In particular, PNES is a very real and debilitating condition, and frankly, I didn't take it seriously enough for far too long during my residency. I regret that very much. People with PNES are not ""faking."" Distinguishing between these things is important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/eutt79/most_things_are_not_seizures/,2020-01-27 20:26:03,agra

"Police destroy a medic area during protests in Asheville, North Carolina.","After protests in Asheville, North Carolina, social media posts that show law enforcement busting water bottles went viral. The [incident Tuesday](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/06/03/asheville-protests-mostly-peaceful-ends-tear-gas-after-curfew-george-floyd/3130666001/) was caught on video and described by a medic volunteer. The protest marked the third day of demonstrations in Asheville in response to the death of a black man, George Floyd, in the custody of Minneapolis police officers.

[Video by the Citizen Times](https://www.citizen-times.com/videos/news/local/2020/06/03/asheville-police-destroy-water-bottles-medic-area/3133824001/) shows Asheville police officers in riot gear and holding shields forming a protective circle around officers stomping and stabbing water bottles. Other officers destroyed medical supplies such as bandages and saline solution.

Sean Miller, a UNC-Asheville student who is head of communication for the medical team, said the 10-12 medics present were all clearly marked as such and did not provoke police in any way. ""A few minutes after 8 o'clock, we saw a SWAT team coming at us,"" Miller said. ""They immediately, when they approached, they said, 'We're Asheville Police Department, and you guys need to leave.' They grabbed us by the shoulders and pushed out of the alleyway where we were trying to provide medical support."" She said they had a verbal agreement with APD to be present, even after curfew.

Some of the medics had bruises and felt the effects of tear gas, but no one was seriously injured. They lost at least $700 in supplies, Miller said. Officers didn't give them an explanation for the destruction, she said.

Glenna Grant, 33, [said she witnessed](https://twitter.com/daveth89/status/1267974555332685824) the officers destroy water bottles and medical supplies. Grant said she and others set up the medical center and did not plan to protest but rather provide a safe space for anyone injured during the night. Grant said officers ""hit them with shields” and took several people to the ground. “We had eye wash, sutures, EMTs and doctors,” Grant said. “They threw several people to the ground. We were thrown, shouted at, screamed at and treated like criminals. No one resisted.”

Jon Jones, who works with the medical team, said police struck down a peaceful operation, and ""those actions are inexcusable."" ""All of those officers took an oath to stand and protect the people, and there's no room for error in that,"" he said. 

In a [Facebook post Wednesday](https://www.facebook.com/esther.e.manheimer/posts/10222847776363880), Mayor Esther Manheimer acknowledged the incident, which occurred at 8:14 p.m. in a small alley off the main public square  downtown. ""I am aware of the incident involving officers destroying the medical supplies of demonstrators, including water bottles, food and other supplies,"" Manheimer wrote. ""Council has asked for an explanation of why that occurred. ""We are a city that cares, and I want to thank all of our officers who have taken a knee and worked to protect us,"" Manheimer continued. ""But this was a disappointing moment in an otherwise peaceful evening.""

Around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Police Chief David Zack issued a statement, explaining the officers were destroying potential projectiles at an unpermitted medical station. He said the medical crew received multiple warnings. ""We apologize for not being able to confiscate these supplies last night,"" Zack said in a news release. ""Over the past three days, APD has tried to eliminate objects that can be thrown at protesters and law enforcement. Because water bottles, in particular, have been continuously used over the last three nights, officers destroyed them. Officers also searched for potentially dangerous objects, such as explosives."" He said the medical station was on private property without permission of the owner.

 Miller disputes the chief's account, saying she was at the station starting at 4 p.m. June 2. ""We didn't receive a single warning,"" she said. ""They didn't warn us whatsoever."" She also said the mention of explosives was perplexing. ""There were absolutely no explosives within the medical area. None,"" Miller said. ""No fireworks, nothing that could even be perceived as dangerous."" Miller did acknowledge that they inadvertently set up on private property June 2 without the property owner's permission. They had spoken with management of the nearby restaurants and thought that was sufficient, she said, but they ""didn't have the awareness that there was a separate company that owned the entire property.""

"I posted a while back seeking a clinical portrait from those caring for COVID19 pts, and found a detailed one today from Evergreen. Please disseminate, esp to ICU/PACU/ED staff.","Got this being passed around my circle of physician co-workers... Somewhat interesting, although for most readers a lot of the medical jargon may be difficult to pick up:

This is from a front-line ICU physician in a Seattle hospital (*purported.  The exact source is being called into question.)

This is his personal account:

* we have 21 pts and 11 deaths since 2/28.

* we are seeing pts who are young (20s), fit, no comorbidities, critically ill. It does happen.

* US has been past containment since January

* Currently, all of ICU is for critically ill COVIDs, all of floor medsurg for stable COVIDs and EOL care, half of PCU, half of ER. New resp-sx pts Pulmonary Clinic offshoot is open

* CDC is no longer imposing home quarantine on providers who were wearing only droplet iso PPE when intubating, suctioning, bronching, and in one case doing bloody neurosurgery. Expect when it comes to your place you may initially have staff home-quarantined. Plan for this NOW. Consider wearing airborne iso PPE for aerosol-generating procedures in ANY pt in whom you suspect COVID, just to prevent the mass quarantines.

* we ran out of N95s (thanks, Costco hoarders) and are bleaching and re-using PAPRs, which is not the manufacturer's recommendation. Not surprised on N95s as we use mostly CAPRs anyway, but still.

*terminal cleans (inc UV light) for ER COVID rooms are taking forever, Enviro Services is overwhelmed. Bad as pts are stuck coughing in the waiting room. Rec planning now for Enviro upstaffing, or having a plan for sick pts to wait in their cars (that is not legal here, sadly).

* CLINICAL INFO based on our cases and info from CDC conf call today with other COVID providers in US:

* the Chinese data on 80% mildly ill, 14% hospital-ill, 6-8% critically ill are generally on the mark. Data very skewed by late and very limited testing, and the number of our elderly pts going to comfort care. - being young & healthy (zero medical problems) does not rule out becoming vented or dead - probably the time course to developing significant lower resp sx is about a week or longer (which also fits with timing of sick cases we started seeing here, after we all assumed it was endemic as of late Jan/early Feb). - based on our hospitalized cases (including the not formally diagnosed ones who are obviously COVID - it is quite clinically unique) about 1/3 have mild lower resp sx, need 1-5L NC. 1/3 are sicker, FM or NRB. 1/3 tubed with ARDS. Thus far, everyone is seeing: - nl WBC. Almost always lymphopenic, occasionally poly-predominant but with nl total WBC. Doesn't change, even 10days in. - BAL lymphocytic despite blood lymphopenic (try not to bronch these pts; this data is from pre-testing time when we had several idiopathic ARDS cases) - fevers, often high, may be intermittent; persistently febrile, often for >10d. It isn't the dexmed, it's the SARS2. - low ProCalc; may be useful to check initially for later trending if later concern for VAP etc. - up AST/ALT, sometimes alk phos. Usually in 70-100 range. No fulminant hepatitis. Notably, in our small sample, higher transaminitis at admit (150-200) correlates with clinical deterioration and progression to ARDS. LFTs typically begin to bump in 2nd week of clinical course. - mild AKI (Cr <2). Uncertain if direct viral effect, but notably SARS2 RNA fragments have been identified in liver, kidneys, heart, and blood.

* characteristic CXR always bilateral patchy or reticular infiltrates, sometimes perihilar despite nl EF and volume down at presentation. At time of presentation may be subtle, but always present, even in our pts on chronic high dose steroids. NO effusions. CT is as expected, rarely mild mediastinal LAD, occ small effusions late in course which might be related to volume status/cap leak.

* Note - China is CT'ing everyone, even outpts, as a primarily diagnostic modality. However, in US/Europe, CT is rare, since findings are nonspecific, would not change management, and the ENTIRE scanner and room have to terminal-cleaned, which is just impossible in a busy hospital. Also, transport in PAPRs. Etc. 2 of our pts had CTs for idiopathic ARDS in the pre-test era; they looked like the CTs in the journal articles. Not more helpful than CXR. - when resp failure occurs, it is RAPID (likely 7-10d out from sx onset, but rapid progression from hospital admit). Common scenario for our pts is, admit 1L NC. Next 12hrs -> NPPV. Next 12-24hrs -> vent/proned/Flolan. - interestingly, despite some needing Flolan, the hypoxia is not as refractory as with H1N1. Quite different, and quite unique. Odd enough that you'd notice and say hmmm. - thus far many are dying of cardiac arrest rather than inability to ventilate/oxygenate. - given the inevitable rapid progression to ETT once resp decompensation begins, we and other hosps, including Wuhan, are doing early intubation. Facemask is fine, but if needing HFNC or NPPV just tube them. They definitely will need a tube anyway, & no point risking the aerosols. - no MOSF. There's the mild AST/ALT elevation, maybe a small Cr bump, but no florid failure. except cardiomyopathy. - multiple pts here have had nl EF on formal Echo or POCUS at time of admit (or in a couple of cases EF 40ish, chronically). Also nl Tpn from ED. Then they get the horrible resp failure, sans sepsis or shock. Then they turn the corner, off Flolan, supined, vent weaning, looking good, never any pressor requirement. Then over 12hrs, newly cold, clamped, multiple-pressor shock that looks cardiogenic, EF 10% or less, then either VT->VF-> dead or PEA-> asystole in less than a day. Needless to say this is awful for families who had started to have hope. - We have actually had more asystole than VT, other facilities report more VT/VF, but same time course, a few days or a week after admit, around the time they're turning the corner. This occurs on med-surg pts too; one today who is elderly and chronically ill but baseline EF preserved, newly hypoTN overnight, EF<10. Already no escalation, has since passed, So presumably there is a viral CM aspect, which presents later in the course of dz. - of note, no WMAs on Echo, RV preserved, Tpns don't bump. Could be unrelated, but I've never seen anything like it before, esp in a pt who had been HD stable without sepsis.

Treatment -

*Remdesivir might work, some hosps have seen improvement with it quite rapidly, marked improvement in 1-3 days. ARDS trajectory is impressive with it, pts improve much more rapidly than expected in usual ARDS.

*Recommended course is 10d, but due to scarcity all hosps have stopped it when pt clinically out of the woods - none have continued >5d. It might cause LFT bump, but interestingly seem to bump (200s-ish) for a day or 2 after starting then rapidly back to normal - suggests not a primary toxic hepatitis.

*unfortunately, the Gilead compassionate use and trial programs require AST/ALT <5x normal, which is pretty much almost no actual COVID pts. Also CrCl>30, which is fine. CDC is working with Gilead to get LFT reqs changed now that we know this is a mild viral hepatitis.

-currently the Gilead trial is wrapping up, NIH trial still enrolling, some new trial soon to begin can't remember where.

*steroids are up in the air. In China usual clinical practice for all ARDS is high dose methylpred. Thus, ALL of their pts have had high dose methylpred. Some question whether this practice increases mortality.

*it is likely that it increases seconday VAP/HAP. China has had a high rate of drug resistant GNR HAP/VAP and fungal pna in these pts, with resulting increases mortality. We have seen none, even in the earlier pts who were vented for >10d before being bronched (prior to test availability, again it is not a great idea to bronch these pts now).

- unclear whether VAP-prevention strategies are also different, but wouldn't think so?

- Hong Kong is currently running an uncontrolled trial of HC 100IV Q8.

- general consensus here (in US among docs who have cared for COVID pts) is that steroids will do more harm than good, unless needed for other indications.

- many of our pts have COPD on ICS. Current consensus at Evergreen, after some observation & some clinical judgment, is to stop ICS if able, based on known data with other viral pneumonias and increased susceptibility to HAP. Thus far pts are tolerating that, no major issues with ventilating them that can't be managed with vent changes. We also have quite a few on AE-COPD/asthma doses of methylpred, so will be interesting to see how they do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/figd1n/i_posted_a_while_back_seeking_a_clinical_portrait/,2020-03-14 10:30:42,morbi
Rant: Don't belittle your colleagues.,"I witnessed two striking examples of unprofessionalism yesterday, and I'm ashamed of both of them.

In the first case I overheard a pair of GIM PGY2s loudly venting about the substandard care given to a patient by a hospitalist service. Have I vented like that? Absolutely. But they came to the conclusion that they would never want to be admitted to any service other than GIM in the hospital because nobody else is a real doctor and will kill you. And they were in a very public place surrounded by other doctors and patients.

In the second case my junior for the night, a PGY1 in neurosurgery, spent 20 minutes ranting to me about how useless and meaningless his 1 month rotation of general surgery is to him...in the middle of us doing an emergency total colectomy at 2 am. I was gently probing him to see if he could find any value in working with his colleagues, or if his patients ever experienced general surgery problems, and he just couldn't fathom why he'd been put through this torture. Nevermind the patient in extremis in front of him.

I get it, stress happens, burn out is real, I'm a chief resident in general surgery, I really do get it. 

Can we stop writing off and bashing entire other segments of medicine? Go punch a bag or take nap instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/e7m1z6/rant_dont_belittle_your_colleagues/,2019-12-07 23:53:25,tanda
More Physician Leadership in the US Healthcare System Would Save Lives. [Serious],"I realize that administration overstep creates frustration in almost every field, from education to anything corporate.  What bothers me most about administrative overstep in healthcare?  It doesn't appear to help patients get better care*, it doesn't rely on physicians,* it is one of the largest expenses in our system, and it is continuing to swell larger.^(1)  

Put generally, the US Healthcare system is failing to justify its costs.

Should wealthy shareholders be profiting to such an extent that we effectively drown the US Healthcare system, or do we ignore political differences and focus on unity through our shared humanity?  Here I will argue that physician de-emphasization has hurt the system, led to our current problems, and must be reversed.

How did this happen?  It’s complicated.  Over the past few decades, a collection of private lobbyists successfully leveraged more financial burdens onto patients and their physicians through corporate and government cost-containment strategies.  Physicians and the public were taken by surprise and did not successfully oppose increasing market-penetration schemes.  This incentivized more clinical scrutiny and administrative control.^(2-5)   Physicians became more inundated with paperwork, liability, and had reimbursements cut.  There was more pressure to make profits, which cut time with patients, and access to care became more restricted.

Ironically, the USA has -- for its expense -- relative underperformance in many metrics used to evaluate healthcare, including access to care, cost-effectiveness, suicide rates, life expectancy, and general pandemic response.^(6-9)   It would follow that reversing this power shift of the healthcare system, away from the wealthy and back into the hands of medical experts, would be the solution.

Physicians just need the public’s support.

A common viewpoint I’ve heard from overwhelmed physicians is that physician advocacy detracts from patient care.  Practically speaking, that is partially true.  However, as physicians, the effectiveness of our healthcare system is partially our responsibility.  As medical experts, our scientific viewpoint is needed to prevent the creation of policies that may hurt more lives than you could ever save in the hospital or clinic.

That is why US physicians must:

1. Admit we are losing our influence and need a change.
2. Resolve to promote a unified front against non-physician control of the US healthcare system.
3. Reverse engineer a long term solution through education on advocacy for medical students and physicians, along with input from the general public.

Great physicians are self-motivated leaders that live by shared humanity with our patients and their families.  Positively affecting the life of another person (in a way that few can) is our greatest reward.  We must become advocacy experts with the same ferocity as we have innovated new medical treatments, procedures, and technologies.

But how do you, a physician, speak out?  We must try to learn about professional advocacy, participate in politics, and talk about your issues with your colleagues.  Find unity.  If you haven’t read the classic book, Freakonomics, it discusses how to naturally incentivize others’ actions, and vice versa.^(9)  Physicians are being incentivized into silence, individualism, and tolerance of hardships for short-term job security, while living on hope that someone else will fix it.  But if our divisions worsen, the hardships will grow.

What hardships?  In the short term, further privatization by managed care firms and insurance companies will just continue to raise prices until fewer and fewer can afford care.^(11-12)  In the long term, non-physician control of the US healthcare system will continue to foster distrust in modern medicine, lessen the efficacy of modern therapies, and create larger costs fixing secondary comorbidities arising from lack of preventative care and logical policymaking.

As a society, we must admit that physicians are being covertly bullied, silenced, and deemphasized to increase healthcare profits for non-physician shareholders and administrators.  Is that what we want?  As patients, we must speak out.  Most recently, hospital shareholders and administrators created physician pay cuts during COVID19 associated declines in patient volume.^(13-15)  Ironically, they are targeted in the name of curbing health care costs, yet administrators in the US healthcare system consume many more health care dollars than physicians.^(16)

Now we all have a decision to make.  Physicians need the public’s support, but we need each other's enthusiasm more.  I encourage you all to educate yourselves on effective advocacy strategies, think outside the box, and look for ways to come together.  Physicians are bound by our Hippocratic oath to speak out against US Healthcare policies that prioritize profits over patients:

\*I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.^(17)

Patients should stand with their physicians and support changes to favor science over money.  Physicians, when you’re feeling discouraged, remember that your patients have placed their lives in your hands.  Your job is not an easy one.  It's not one that most people can do.  Your voice counts.  Your actions matter.  What will you do?

# We’re in this together.

**TL;DR:**  US Healthcare is not justifying its expense.  Cost-cutting measures and profiteering policies created by non-physician administrators are worsening this.  Physicians regain must speak out to regain control of the healthcare system.  The public must be educated and support the movement.

Anonymous writings of a covid nurse - part 2,"*One…two…three…four…five…six…seven….*

It takes me exactly three hundred and eighty-seven steps to walk the entire loop of my unit and arrive back where I started. I should know…I’ve counted it hundreds of times by now.

Back in the days before when I could find the time, I would toss my Vocera at any willing coworker and meander around campus for fifteen minutes or so to get a break from the demands of being a bedside nurse. I’d wander outside to the employee patio and get a glimpse of the sky, sit next to the fountain, enjoy the sun a bit. Maybe pick my way through the gift shop and buy some trinket to bring home to my daughter. Sometimes I’d go visit my friends that had transferred to other floors. Such social calls were normal back then. It wasn’t always possible of course, but before all of this it was possible to find the time more often than it wasn’t.

It started with a single patient at first. Then it was two. Six. Fourteen. They’ll only be placed in negative pressure rooms, it was announced. That lasted for approximately five days. Then any positive case requiring less than six LPM were allowed in standard rooms. Thirty-five. We can handle it, our CEO proclaimed. There were plans in place. Fifty-three. Elective procedures were cancelled. PPE was short, you’ll need to reuse your N95. Place it in this brown paper bag and keep it on your iso carts. Nono, it’s perfectly safe, probably. Seventy-nine. Units were locked. Patient loads were getting top-heavy and cumbersome to manage. Incentive pay was announced. Then increased. Then increased again. One hundred and four. “Heroes work here” signs. Codes overhead every hour, the sickening feeling of ribs breaking under your hands. Exhaustion. Difficulty sleeping. Two hundred and twenty-two. So many stroke alerts. The sound of families sobbing over Zoom as their loved ones gasped their last breaths. Two hundred and fifty-four. Will this fucking pager ever *stop beeping.* Single rooms are now doubles, a Black Friday two for one. Two hundred and ninety-nine. Coworkers are getting sick at an alarming rate. Anna’s on the vent in MICU waitlisted to be transferred to a different facility for ECMO because we’re at capacity. Chris was just admitted, he’s on IMCU riding the vapotherm and looking like shit. Three hundred and thirty-one. Blistered feet. Nine days in a row and three more on the schedule. Crash intubation after crash intubation. The claustrophobic feeling of drowning in patients, tasks, and dexamethasone. Three hundred and eighty-eight. Bleeding cuticles, grinding teeth without noticing until your jaw aches. How can this continue? How can this…how….

…

And just when I thought this whole godforsaken house was about to collapse, it began to ease.

I took to pacing my locked unit like a caged tiger after the last wave crested, turning corner after corner within the same four walls. There was still no time for campus walks anymore, and we were forbidden that sort of freedom of movement anyway. But by then it felt like a cardinal sin to sit down and do nothing. Returning to some semblance of normal didn’t quite feel normal to me yet. Instead, my usual fifteen minute cool-down period had turned into a way to expend bottled anxiety and energy.

“Getting your steps in, Taylor?” my coworkers would ask.

I’d fake a smile, nod, and keep going.

Two hundred and five. I cut down to a normal amount of overtime. One hundred and seventy-one. My arm hurt like a motherfucker after that vaccine. Ninety-eight. Electives resumed. Sixty. Floors were converted back to their original service designations. Fourty-four. My dad, full of optimism and synthetic mRNA, visited for the first time in eleven months. We drank a beer on the patio and laughed at the absurdity of the cardboard cutout fans in the stands of the game we were watching. Twenty-seven.

It’s oddly quiet around here now. The amount of emails I receive from administration have dropped off precipitously. During the surge, I would count the number of red-orange covid isolation signs taped to the doors on my daily prowls. At one point they adorned every single room.

Today, I count three.

It feels as if the dust has settled a bit. The place looks normal but has the same palpable tension as an empty street, littered with the broken glass and spent tear-gas cannisters that inevitably follow a riot. We may have swept the debris into the gutters, but the memory of the event hangs in the air like the lingering scent of sulphur. The faces of my colleagues are no longer so worn. We’re all dealing with what we’ve seen in different ways. Some are dealing better than others. Some aren’t dealing with it at all. A stoic few deny there’s anything to deal with in the first place. This is what we do, they scoff. This is what we’re here for.

I don’t know where I fall on this spectrum.

“Try not to focus on all the lost causes,” my favorite tech instructs me after we rambled a bit on the topic at lunch. “I mean…have you thought about all the ones we saved?”

I pause. It’s so easy to focus on the negative that I’m ashamed to admit I haven’t.

“What about that one guy that was in bed 3 forever?” she continues. “You discharged him on New Year’s Day. He’d been on a vent for like two weeks. That was pretty amazing.”

It was, I agree.

“And remember Mrs. Graham, or Garman, or…whatever her name was. She was here for over 90 days and walked out under her own power without oxygen.”

I must have taken care of her at least a dozen times or better and I’d completely forgotten about her. Unbelievable.

I spend the remainder of my two scheduled shifts catching my coworkers during lulls and asking them about their saves, too. Ashley tells me about Mr. Sacks who she discharged to LTACH. He’s walking now, she quips. Casey reminds me of another patient who was able to have their trach and PEG discontinued before leaving. That guy that had the stroke while SAPed? We thought he’d leave in a body bag but he’s back to work. And we all remember our most memorable case, a failed compassionate extubation that sent a freakin’ Christmas card to the staff after breezing through rehab.

The stories start piling up. Five. Twelve. Twenty-eight. I stop counting and catch myself smiling, feeling lighter than I have in a year.

It’s unrealistic to think that any of us will ever be exactly the same as we were before living through these times. God knows I won’t. But at least now, I can view these memories like a coin. One side contains all of the anger, the hurt, and the sheer misery that we were forced to stomach as we performed our duties. But the other? It holds the precious victories, the joy we saw on our patient’s faces as they left our facility. The times we went toe to toe with death and won.

I’m back at work tomorrow morning. Maybe I’ll skip down to the fountain, take my mask off, and sit for a bit. It's past time to see if things still looks the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/mnql47/anonymous_writings_of_a_covid_nurse_part_2/,2021-04-09 21:01:10,tanda
I'm sick of the fringe medicine,"Believe me, I am all for the practice of medicine. Sometimes you have to get a bit creative in treatment plans. Patients who for some reason don't want to take a blood pressure pill and have terrible anxiety, fine we will settle on long acting propranolol because that is the only thing they agree to take.

Screw these doctors who are pushing bullshit though.


In the past 6 months I've been getting more and more out there treatments though showing up at my door.

Turns out there is a doctor now nearby who is into ""biohacking"" functional medicine and doing twice yearly DEXA scans and 10 pages of labs. Website links to his book and his store where you can even buy salmon that he certifies, a HEPA filter for covid, and a fucking 5g faraday cage https://imgur.com/a/gczd5cj (edit the link since the previous crop was bad and had the doctors name on the supplements.)

Two of this doctors patients this week have landed in my clinic requesting testosterone therapy and DEXA order + 90 pills of Viagra and Adderall.

I request previous labs and review them this morning. Initial testosterone levels were in the 400s in one patient and 500s in another prior to starting on testosterone it seems.

These patients yelled at my staff and got all upset that I would not refill their meds.

Shame on anyone who falls into this money making BS.

The Penis-Eating Kobold Vacuum Cleaner - a Partial Translation of the Most Absurd Case Series in Medical History,"**The Penis-Eating Kobold Vacuum Cleaner - a Partial Translation of the Most Absurd Case Series in Medical History**

**Introduction**: The penis-eating Kobold vacuum cleaner is a marvelous story, legend and meme among medical students and physicians in the German-speaking world. And not only among them, through public readings by renown authors and actors and an own audiobook, this case series made its way into a broader German audience. Talking with non-Germans, I realized this great piece of medical history has not been previously translated into English.

**Objective**: To entertain medical professionals outside of the German-speaking world.

**Results**: Ongoing.

**Conclusion**: Kobold vacuum cleaner goes brrrr.

**Full text**

""[Penis Injuries during Masturbation with Vacuum Cleaners](http://brennessel.blogsport.de/images/DOKTORARBEIT_Penisverletzungen_bei_Masturbation_mit_Staubsaugern.pdf)"" is the full title of this Dr. med. thesis from the Faculty of Medicine of the Technical University of Munich from 1978. It is obviously graphic and not safe for work unless you are an urologist, I guess.

*Skip this part if you are not interested in academical bureaucracy*: To summarize this ""*byzantine scheme*"" (a quote from a redditor on this sub) briefly: German physicians graduate from medical school with no Dr. title by default, they are just ""Herr Max Mustermann, Arzt"" or ""Frau Erika Mustermann, Ärztin"", basically ""Mr. John Doe, physician."" To be able to call yourself Dr. med. NAME, you need to **finish and defend a Dr. med. thesis**. These have a huge variety from meaningful experimental or clinical projects, often with a strong publication as first author, up to retrospective chart-review projects which would sometimes barely pass as a master thesis in other sciences. Within German law, the Dr. med. is theoretically on par with the Dr. phil or Dr. rer. nat. (most common types of PhD) but since the quality is so often below the standards of a PhD, the EU does not recognize it as a PhD for e.g. grant eligibility. The proportion of medical students and graduates finishing Dr. med. projects is at 55-70% and declining since the job market got much, much better since the 90s. No offense to the author of the thesis, but it would likely be not accepted in this form nowadays.

Anyways, in this Dr. med. thesis, Michael Alschibaja Theimuras, at this time an urology resident at the *Clinic on the Right Bank of the Isar,* the university hospital of TU Munich reviewed 16 cases of Penis injuries caused by men masturbating with a particular type of a German vacuum cleaner, the ""Kobold"" of the company Vorwerk & CO., Elektro KG., Wuppertal. This type was found in 8 cases while the information was missing in the 8 other ones. The insidious thing about this vacuum cleaner until it had to be changed after these findings: After just 11 cm, anything inserted makes contact with a rotating propeller. Dr. Theimuras is still a practicing urologist in his private practice in Munich, his son by the same name is his partner.

While penis injuries are not particularly funny on their own, the mode of injury and the stories the patients provided as explanations are what makes this thesis a gem. We all know ""I fell on it."" This is even better. I will concentrate on the best, especially cases 14 and 15 which are gold in combination.

>Case 9 Be., 60 years old, Roman Catholic \[*this is the 70s, of course this is relevant!*\], divorced, occupation: haulage contractor  
>  
>Case history  
>  
>The patient allegedly injured his penis while repairing a coffee grinder. However, everything clearly pointed to vacuum cleaner injury.

&#x200B;

>Case 10, Fe., 59 years old, Roman Catholic, divorced, occupation: mechanic  
>  
>Mode of injury  
>  
>His girlfriend had been cleaning the apartment on the day of the accident. He was lying on the bed. She wanted to tease him and put the vacuum cleaner over his abdomen. He had felt an exciting tickling sensation in his penis. To intensify this, she would take off the brush attachment of the vacuum cleaner (brand ""Kobold""). When his girlfriend then touched his non-erect penis with the vacuum cleaner suction tube, the penis was sucked into the vacuum cleaner. He felt a terrible pain. Because he was embarrassed, he first tried to treat his penis wounds himself. But when after 10 hours the bleeding had not stopped, he went to a physician.

&#x200B;

>Case 11, Be., 70 years old, no religion, divorced, occupation: pensioner  
>  
>Case history:  
>  
>The patient stated that he had fallen from a table onto a garden chair and had sustained a penile injury during this. Such a depiction is very unlikely. The nature of the injury is typical of a vacuum cleaner injury.

&#x200B;

>Case 13, Ju., 46 years old, Roman Catholic, married, occupation: insurance clerk  
>  
>Case history:  
>  
>The patient stated that he had been cleaning his car with a vacuum cleaner. Since the vacuum cleaner did not belong to him, he was not familiar with the device and accidentally hit the switch. He had just taken off his pants but had not yet put on his swimming trunks. At the moment when the vacuum cleaner went on, his penis was in the immediate vicinity of the suction tube. He felt a strong suction on the penis and then everything was drowning in blood.

&#x200B;

>Case 14, Zi., 31 years old, married, occupation: welder  
>  
>Case history  
>  
>The 31-year-old patient had been married for 2 years. According to his own statement, he had been raised very strictly. Sexual problems were never discussed in his parental home. He had also never been taught sexual education. He had masturbated for the first time at the age of 14. Until his marriage, he had masturbated about twice a week. His wife had a strict Catholic upbringing. He describes living a harmonious marriage. However, his wife was sexually very reserved.

Stanford faculty disavow former colleague Scott Atlas - Trump's current favorite physician adviser on COVID,"[EDIT: Apologies for keeping the mods busy!]

This letter was sent out to all Stanford School of Medicine faculty yesterday. The signatories include virtually every notable member of the ID, micro/immunology, and epidemiology/pop health departments, including the former Dean. They aren't mincing words. https://imgur.com/gallery/EJZxe7B

September 9, 2020

Dear Colleagues,

As infectious diseases physicians and researchers, microbiologist and immunologists,
epidemiologists and health policy leaders, we stand united in efforts to develop and promote
science-based solutions that advance human health and prevent suffering from the coronavirus
pandemic. In this pursuit, we share a commitment to a basic principle derived from the
Hippocratic Oath: Primum Non Nocere (First, Do No Harm).

To prevent harm to the public’s health, we also have both a moral and an ethical responsibility to
call attention to the falsehoods and misrepresentations of science recently fostered by Dr. Scott
Atlas, a former Stanford Medical School colleague and current senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University. Many of his opinions and statements run counter to established
science and, by doing so, undermine public-health authorities and the credible science that
guides effective public health policy. The preponderance of data, accrued from around the
world, currently supports each of the following statements:

● The use of face masks, social distancing, handwashing and hygiene have been shown to
substantially reduce the spread of Covid-19. Crowded indoor spaces are settings that
significantly increase the risk of community spread of SARS-CoV-2.

● Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 frequently occurs from asymptomatic people, including
children and young adults, to family members and others. Therefore, testing
asymptomatic individuals, especially those with probable Covid-19 exposure is important
to break the chain of ongoing transmission.

● Children of all ages can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. While infection is less common
in children than in adults, serious short-term and long-term consequences of Covid-19 are
increasingly described in children and young people.

● The pandemic will be controlled when a large proportion of a population has developed
immunity (referred to as herd immunity) and that the safest path to herd immunity is
through deployment of rigorously evaluated, effective vaccines that have been approved
by regulatory agencies.

● In contrast, encouraging herd immunity through unchecked community transmission is
not a safe public health strategy. In fact, this approach would do the opposite, causing a
significant increase in preventable cases, suffering and deaths, especially among
vulnerable populations, such as older individuals and essential workers.

Commitment to science-based decision-making is a fundamental obligation of public
health policy. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the US, with consequent morbidity
and mortality, are among the highest in the world. The policy response to this pandemic
must reinforce the science, including that evidence-based prevention and the safe
development, testing and delivery of efficacious therapies and preventive measures,
including vaccines, represent the safest path forward. Failure to follow the science -- or
deliberately misrepresenting the science – will lead to immense avoidable harm.
We believe that social and economic activity can reopen safely, if we follow policies that
are consistent with science. In fact, the countries that have reopened businesses and
schools safely are those that have implemented the science-based strategies outlined
above.

As Stanford faculty with expertise in infectious diseases, epidemiology and health policy,
our signatures support this statement with the hope that our voices affirm scientific,
medical and public health approaches that promote the safety of our communities and
nation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ipzel6/stanford_faculty_disavow_former_colleague_scott/,2020-09-10 08:27:43,morbi
Why the Appropriation of the Terms Residency and Fellowship is Wrong,"Residency training has been part of physician education after medical school for about [125 years](https://www.ama-assn.org/education/improve-gme/history-residency-and-what-lies-ahead).  Initially, though, residency wasn’t a requirement following medical school. Today, physicians must complete at least one year of residency to obtain a license to practice medicine–in some states, even that [isn’t enough](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2019/09/california-to-require-three-years-of-gme-for-full-physician-licensure/).

To become board-certified, physicians must complete 3 to 7 years of residency, depending on their chosen specialty. **Physicians in their first year of residency are often known as interns.**

Fellowships are physician education beyond residency.  A fellowship is meant to provide more specialized training within a specific field of medicine. For instance, after finishing a residency in Internal Medicine (3 years after medical school), a physician might choose to then specialize in cardiology by doing a Cardiology Fellowship (another 3 years).

Physician residencies and fellowships are accredited by the [Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME),](https://www.acgme.org/What-We-Do/Overview)which ensures that uniform standards are met for all programs. These standards include educational guidelines, milestones, and assessments, along with graduated patient care responsibility. The ACGME annually reviews all programs to ensure compliance with the standards, and they regularly update their standards to ensure excellent trainee education.

*Residencies and fellowships are rigorous undertakings. Traditionally, these trainees are referred to as “housestaff” or “house officers,” terms which* [*originated* ](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/house-officer)*from the time when trainees literally lived in “house” at the hospital.*

## Appropriations of the Terms “Residency” and “Fellowship”

It has recently been brought to light that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) have developed programs that institutions are calling “residencies” and “fellowships.” While this was spurred on by recent news of a possible NP/PA Emergency Medicine “Residency” at the University of North Carolina (UNC), UNC is hardly alone in this. To their credit, once they learned of the opposition to the use of the term residency, they have agreed that any future program that is developed will not utilize that term.

However, many programs still exist at other institutions, including, but not limited to, the [Johns Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/education_training/nurse_practitioner_fellowship_program.html), the [Mayo Clinic](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/health-sciences-education/nurse-practitioner-or-physician-assistant-emergency-medicine-fellowship-minnesota/), [Massachusetts General (Harvard)](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/pcgm/palliative-care/education/np-fellowship), [Penn State](https://residency.med.psu.edu/programs/apc-dermatology-fellowship/), and [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vumc.org/nursingoap/50658). With few exceptions, these programs are just 12 months in length, often with multiple “administrative half days.” Further, these programs are not necessarily standardized or accredited. In many of these fellowships, the NP or PA is paid more than a first-year physician resident who has completed far more training while in medical school.

Lastly, and perhaps most disheartening, many of these programs claim equivalence with physician training, although they are 1/3 or less of the residency training time for physicians. Some of the programs claim “[comparable training experiences](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/education_training/nurse_practitioner_fellowship_program.html)” to physicians with “[residents functioning as house-staff members.](https://www.montefiore.org/critical-care-professional-training-programs-residency)” By simple definition, PAs and NPs, while valued members of the team, cannot function at the same level as a physician resident or fellow. They simply do not have the same rigorous basic science and clinical education that physicians receive during medical school.

Even beyond NP and PA training using the terms “residency” and “fellowship” are the nursing (RN) programs doing the same.  Some hospitals have [renamed their RN orientation process, calling it “residency”](https://www.nursingcas.org/inside-the-nurse-residency-experience/).  Using these words, which have long been part of physician training lexicon, for new nurse orientation and onboarding, devalues them and can confuse patients.

## Why This is Wrong

When patients are admitted to the hospital, they often see interns, residents and fellows as part of their treatment team. Physicians introduce themselves and their role on the team. When PAs and NPs introduce themselves as a resident or fellow, it is very confusing to patients. Patients do not understand that they are not seeing a physician. In fact, even without this confusing terminology, patients are confused about who is taking care of them. The AMA did a survey that found that [35% of the general public](https://www.entnet.org/sites/default/files/TIA.6-30-2014.AMA%20Survey.pdf) believed that NPs with their doctorate of nursing practice were physicians.

Completing a residency or fellowship is a significant milestone in physician education, and it’s something physicians aspire to and celebrate.  When other fields appropriate physician-specific terminology for a portion of their training, it is demoralizing.

*Physicians consider their time in residency and fellowship as an initiation into the profession. It is a time of great emotional, personal, and financial sacrifice, all in the name of honing skills to become the best physician possible for their patients.*

When these terms are misused, it cheapens the physician experience. **Physician burnout and suicide are at an all time high and, to put it frankly, we cannot stand more blows.**

## Taking a Stand

At least two professional organizations, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) have taken a stand against this. In the AAD [position statement](https://server.aad.org/Forms/Policies/Uploads/PS/PS-Dermatology%20Residency%20and%20Fellowship%20Training.pdf), they state that the “education of physicians and non-physician clinicians is entirely different…this labeling \[of advanced practice residencies or fellowships\] is **misleading to the general public as it portrays a level of training that has not been established**.”

The AAEM [position statement](https://www.aaem.org/resources/statements/position/em-training-programs-for--pas-and-nps) takes it a step further and recommends that NP/PA education programs should only be used to “prepare its participants to practice only as members of a physician-led team” and “should be initiated with the consultation of residents and faculty.” We hope that other organizations and institutions take a stance and re-name these programs. One example is Brown University’s “[Physician Extender Development Program.](https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/about/departments/emergency-medicine/emped)”

## A Call for Change

When you are in the hospital or at a clinic, you may be taken care of by interns, residents, fellows, attendings, and non-physician clinicians. Traditionally, interns, residents, fellows and attendings are all physicians who have completed medical school. Non-physician clinicians include physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs).

**PAs and NPs are now calling their additional training “fellowships” or “residencies” and may refer to themselves as a resident or fellow. However, they are not physicians and their programs are not rigorously standardized or accredited. We hope these programs will change their terminology and find their own language for NP and PA training.**

List of covid lies - did I miss any?,"1. The mRNA vaccines cause infertility - it doesn't
2. The vaccines are still ""experimental"" - They are not, over 3.8 BILLION doses have been given. 
3. The pᴉʌoɔ vaccine has nanobots - lol
4. The pᴉʌoɔ vaccine has a microchip in it - it doesn't, the microchip is in your phone and the facebook app you are using
5. I can't get it ""insert some medical reason"" - This is obviously a discussion you should have with your doctor, however- if you are truly one of the less than 1% of people who it is recommended against you should be encouraging everyone else to get the vaccine as you are very high risk to die from pᴉʌoɔ.
6.  buy and hodl doge
7.  I am pregnant, I can’t get it – yes you can and should, pregnant women are high risk to end up in the ICU/die from pᴉʌoɔ.  
8.  Masks don’t help protect from respiratory illness – lol
9.  FDA hasn’t approved it yet – Yes, they have.  They just have a mechanism to approve things quicker called an EUA.  The only reason it is still under the EUA is because of their antiquated waiting period. 
10.  I am young and healthy so pᴉʌoɔ won’t affect me – See our current ICU census
11.  We have other effective treatments such as ivermectin, HCQ, etc – No we don’t. None of them have shown any benefit in pᴉʌoɔ.  We have a vaccine and oxygen and a breathing tube. 
12. The government can’t mandate things, this is America – see seatbelts
13.  There is a controversy among physicians, there are two sides – no there aren’t.  There are 58000 Emergency Medicine physicians in the US.  96% of them are vaccinated.  
14.  I don’t know who to believe – Believe physicians, epidemiologists, etc.  Don’t believe your cousin on facebook.  If I have a plumbing problem, I am going to call a plumber.  I don’t ask the plumber about rumors I heard on facebook on why he is using a sharkbite fitting vs a pressure fitting.  
15.  God will protect me – God is protecting you if you choose to accept it, he gave us a vaccine for a reason
16.  The pharmaceutical companies are just in it for the money – possibly true but: Pfizer wants you to live so they can make more money.  E.G. Viagra – dead people don’t buy Viagra
17.  Vaccines have bad long-term effects – no they don’t, we have been vaccinating people for almost 100 years.  All the side effects happen in the first ~3 weeks.  Pᴉʌoɔ has bad long-term effects.
18.  none of the politicians I trust have gotten vaccine
19.  Experts posting on facebook doesn’t do anything –it does, more than you know.  I know that hundreds of people have made the decision to get vaccinated at least partly from my and other physicians’ posts. 
20.  Us vaccinated folk need to not worry about other peoples vaccination status – yes we do.  My kids can’t get vaccinated.  I am on an experimental immune modulator(so I have no idea how protected I am).  I also worry about people running stop signs.  
21.  All opinions matter – they do not E.G., the big lebowsky
22.  The vaccine is dangerous – it is thousands of times less dangerous than pᴉʌoɔ
23.  I will not get pᴉʌoɔ – yes you will
24.  I already had pᴉʌoɔ, so I don’t need a vaccine – The science is still out on this.  However, every physician I know who had pᴉʌoɔ also got the vaccine.  The data shows you are more protected from the vaccine than from pᴉʌoɔ.  We don’t know how long the protection lasts from either.  I am currently recommending the vaccine to anyone who is recovered from pᴉʌoɔ.  You don’t have to wait months to get it.
25.  I had pᴉʌoɔ before there was pᴉʌoɔ – ok pᴉʌoɔ hipster

My experience as a front-line doctor in a 3rd World Country,"
**My experience as a front-line doctor in a 3rd World Country:**


After finishing med school, doctors in India do a year of internship in a hospital. The US MD system gives me a splitting headache, so I'll compare it to the Foundation Year 1 of UK MBBS doctors as a 1:1 equivalent.


At this stage, you are nominally a qualified doctor, with a provisional certificate, and are allowed to practise under the eye of a senior.

Of course, the degree of autonomy is high, as our seniors are overworked and understaffed, so we're mostly left to our own devices unless something very unfamiliar shows up. In some cases, the interns outright run the show, with the Post Grads showing up once or twice a week, not that we had to go through that ourselves. 


I personally went from the freezer to the fire, with no frying pan in between, going from a rather provincial, rural and low occupancy hospital to one that's just about the busiest in the whole country. Let's recap my experience here so far-


India has a mixed healthcare system, as by law, all citizens are entitled to free medical care at any government hospital. Given the relative poverty of the country, they do roaring business, while the middle class and above prefer to visit private clinics and hospitals due to lower congestion and less headache in general.

Think of it like the NHS, but poor in everything except potential patients haha.

Now, Government hospitals get a *bad rep* in this country. There's a good reason why most people who can afford it prefer private care. They're insanely crowded, with doctor:patient ratios that are rounding errors, and many of them have near permanent camps on premises where the family of the patients stay due to an inability to afford better. 

Noisy, dirty, overcrowded. All of these are true.


But somehow, the fucking things *work*.

Before I started work here, I had no personal experience with them, having studied at  and visited private clinics all my life. I was expecting the absolute worst, and gritting my teeth hoping to make it through the year.


Let's just say that my arrival at the **Medicine Ward** did little to disillusion me.

Every available bed had a patient crammed onto it, and trying to cross the ward was an exercise in hop scotch, or crossing a minefield. It was 50:50 whether you'd step on one of patients who had been shunted to the floor, or a pile of poop.

Thankfully (?) it turned out to be *cat* poop.


You'd think you'd visited the lair of a combined hoarder/crazy cat lady, there about 2 of them for every patient, they walked around like they owned the place, ate the leftovers, and lubricated the floors.

On my first day, I heard two senior doctors remarking on a remarkably mishappen kitten, with bulbous eyeballs, and how the rest of the litter was turning off.

It quickly dawned on me that you couldn't expect any better from cats raised on a diet of human blood and teratogenic drugs from the disposal bins where 'proper waste disposal' was more of a suggestion than a firm guideline.


Now, if you think the doctors were living a life of luxury while their patients cosplayed for Oliver Twist, you couldn't be further from the mark.

Our single room for the oncalls was barely cleaner than the wards, and only had the minor benefit of air-conditioning.

In exchange for cats, it had an abundance of cockroaches, aping a rather crappy Tom and Jerry knockoff called Oggie and the Cockroaches, because Cat and Rat is *passe*, but Cat and Cockroach isn't.

For the first 2 weeks with 24 hour duties, I didn't sleep a moment, for fear of being overrun. Sleep did win over in the end, but I spent quite a bit of time fruitlessly spraying insecticides to no discernable effect. The immigration from the ward was far too strong.


You'd go on rounds, and have a roughly 25% chance of finding a dead patient, who had passed away quietly and unremarkably in the humid night, exhaling away with their last breath the blessing of silence to their neighbors, who tossed, turned and moaned in the heat.

Some claim that cats can tell when someone is about to die, and love climbing onto them. Apparently it's something to do with the higher temperatures of the moribund and fevered, but our resident felines didn't give a shit. Only the flies stayed behind, I hope when they sat on sightless eyes and rubbed their hands gleefully, it counted as a prayer to some twisted god, because nobody else would bother.. 

I convinced myself the deaths didn't hurt me, until about a month in, when I found one of our John Does dead on the floor, and then, half an hour later, just as I was about to reach a patient in order to check his pressure and pulse before our rounds, I was met by grievous wails. His daughter was sobbing next to her, begging me *""Why?""* as I dropped to the floor, and confirmed that he was indeed dead.

I knew it wasn't my fault, the man had enough comorbidities to be a medical curiosity, but when I went back to the room, I found my eyes burning with angry tears, and a sob from my chest as I realized my impotence in the vast scheme of things.

There was nobody to console me, and I haven't cried since.


I left the ward bitter. And definitely with toxoplasmosis.


But happily enough, this is where the horror stories end.

In the rest of my rotations, in Surgery, Gynecology, and Orthopedics, I was impressed by the general cleanliness and efficiency of the place.

99% of our patients received timely, adequate care, pretty much all the drugs on the WHO's essential medications list was available, and we never lacked for access to all the other medical paraphernalia such as IV cannulas, urobags etc.

Surgeries were done swiftly, competently and with **strict** asepsis, especially orthopedics, where we were scared to breathe for fear of being yelled at for contaminating something haha.


Some of the benefits to practicing here were-

1) Defensive medicine hasn't become ubiquitous here. Sure, we're on the hook, but the sheer litigiousness that plagues the US hasn't made it to this subcontinent. Barring gross incompetence, patients here mostly grin and bear it.

2) Oh Jesus I've seen enough patients here for two lifetimes, whatever deficiencies existed in my clinical knowledge were treated as firmly as dropping a baby with scurvy into a swimming pool filled with lemons.


3)Dealing with insurance was a non-issue, everyone was treated for free, I take it this is a serious pain for US doctors? 

4) Very competent teachers. You sort of have to be, to even keep your head above water.

The cons, however-

1) You've never experienced the true extent and horror of crippling poverty until you've been at a government hospital. For many, **free** Healthcare is a cost too high to bear, as affording transport from whatever rural village they came from stretched their resources to breaking point. I've seen so many tense up when I tell them that they need a medication that isn't freely available, and try to beg and bargain for a free replacement. Sadly, there often isn't any..

2) Insanely rude and disrespectful behavior towards patients and their companions is everywhere. Minor errors will get them yelled at, half the time nobody is willing to clear any confusions they might have. They might simply be unable to navigate instructions written in English.

3) I've seen women get *slapped* by female doctors  in gynecology, if they were being uncooperative in the midst of labor. If physical assault doesn't faze you, some of them were even told and threatened with the death of their babies in-utero if they didn't shut up and stop screaming from the pain of something as soporific as child birth. 

To an extent, I understand this, even if I don't condone it. When you have 5 minutes at most per patient, a line several hundred long, and you're forced to deal with severe stupidity, it's *very very easy* to just **snap**. Thankfully, I never felt the urge to lay hands on patients myself, let alone give into it.. 

4)Due to insufficient non-medical staff, the family and friends of patients are expected to handle all the gruntwork of getting X-rays done, arranging for blood bags to be brought etc. If you don't have someone around to handle this, you're really, really fucked. You might be able to hire someone to do it, but given our demographics.. They simply went untreated or treated very late when someone was cajoled into doing it. 

5) GPs get no respect here. Not having an MD after your MBBS is seen as a sign of serious deficiency, and fuels a self-fulfilling cycle.

6) On the topic of MDs: Our government has an extremely paternalistic attitude towards doctors, and on completion of your 3 years of MD training, you're obliged to go for 2 years of 'Bond Posting', which, while it gives you a License to Kill Germs, is not nearly as cool as it sounds. You *will* get sent to some rural backwater village, and in India, unlike the US, backwater doesn't mean that they have DSL internet, but dirt poor villages where electricity is far from given, where you'll might even  be operating under the leaves of a banyan tree, which in all likelihood is a cooler and more sanitary place than the mouldy Primary Healthcare Centre that is nominally the nexus of care for about 50k people. You get underpaid, overworked, and everything can fall on your shoulders if you're the only doctor around. The 'bond' here comes from the rule that you need to pay a fine of around INR 3, 000,000,in order to leave early, which is about $40,000. Given PPP, that is an enormous sum, and enough to dissuade most people from leaving. What ends up happening quite often is that Doctors hire other, incompetent or actually *unlicensed* 'doctors' to work in their staid, paying them portions of their own salary so that they can fuck off and actually work in humane conditions. That's a good outcome in fact, because what happens in certain states is that the money gets paid as a bribe to government officials, so that the doctor is marked as physically present, while the actual PHC consists of a goat on a chain and a register book. The book and the chain are government property, and the goat only lives there part time. 

Needless to say, I despise this high handedness on the part of the Government, as instead of paying a market wage or doing any actual infrastructure development, they force us to do 'social service' on grounds of alleviating the pressure of medical care in the the hinterlands. No other profession, such as lawyers or engineers, are conscripted in such a manner either. Anyway, to the GOI, 'supply and demand' is a Western Concept, and hence intrinsically suspicious. Why do anything so crude when you can club people over the head and make them work for you in severely demotivating conditions, so they can rubber stamp treatment and pack people off to the big city? 

7) **I DON'T GET PAID**. Not a cent. This is because I chose to leave my old hospital and switch to the big city, a move that deprived me to my right of a salary. So not only am I overworked, I'm not even paid. I knew this before going, but I can't say it didn't hurt not having disposable income. 

To sum it up: I think I made the right decision going here. I've seen the Ur-Example of Medicine, up close and personal. It's been painful, and I wish I got paid, but take the good with the bad.


Either way, I intend to emigrate to the UK, I don't really fit in, culturally or memetically speaking here, and after running the Rat Race and sort of winning, all I've become is Dr. Rat. 

Dr. Scott Alexander, of [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com) fame, inspired me to get into Psychiatry. (That and reasonable working hours!) I manged to miss my psychiatry rotation because all non-emergency admissions were closed while COVID was shaking out, but hey, it sure sounded nice. 

(He happened to see and reply the first time I posted this whopper, which admittedly has me tickled pink and awaiting the return of his regular posting.)


I hope that this account was somewhat illuminating, especially since I doubt this topic ever came up here.

Interesting case presentation- 30 something year old minimally responsive,"Hey guys, given the good response from the last [case](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/jslnwh/interesting_case_presentation_50_something_yo_man/) I posted, I wanted to keep this going. Again, this is a case not so much about the diagnosis (which is interesting), but the process of caring for this patient. This case will not have a good outcome like the last, but there are always important teaching points and learning points for myself with every case, good or bad. 

A little background information about me. I'm a US emergency medicine attending who works in a community/academic setting. This case is at a 45 bed 70,000 annual visit ER in a hospital that is part of a large system of hospitals in the city I live in. This hospital and ER is very well staffed, we have 12 nurses, 3 techs, an RT, there are 2 other attending ER docs on with me at the time and 1 medical student who is doing their EM rotation with me. My shift ends at 4am. 

So it is 0100, I am 3 hours away from the end of another uneventful shift. I only have three other active patients, all non-emergencies. As I am sitting at my computer, a nurse runs up to me and tells me they don't have a lot of information, but they are going to need my help in bed 7 immediately. 

I walk into the room as they are wheeling in a minimally responsive 30 something yo Hispanic male who is pale and breathing 45x a minute. His LLS score is positive. The report I got from the nurse that found him was that he was dropped off by some ""friends"" who didn't know his name or any of his medical problems. They said something about there being a lot of blood and then took off. 

The patient is confused, agitated, intermittently responsive, but unable to answer any questions. His shirt is already off, there is a small amount of dried blood on his abdomen, and some more on his jeans. 

Outside of obtaining vitals, **what is the first couple assessments you should be making in this patient?**

......

..........

..............

...................

........................

There are a couple answers for this, but the best answer is the ABC's of resuscitation, or airway, breathing, circulation, and importantly, exposing the patient. All we know is that the patient was dropped off, he is pale, looks like shit and likely on the verge of death, and there was reportedly ""a lot of blood"", so we should be considering trauma. His airway was patent as he intermittently screamed, he was severely tachypneic but breath sounds are normal and symmetrical, and he has faint pulses in all extremities w/ an absence of cap refill. We then cut his jeans and underwear off and quickly looked for any wounds including looking at his back and perineum. There was no evidence of any trauma to his body. Of note, his upper abdomen did appear to be distended. 

His initial VS were HR 111, BP 70/33, RR 45, O2 sat 99% on RA, T 35.6C. 

**What are you thinking as the likely diagnosis? What are the initial tests you want to order? And how are you going to immediately treat this patient?**

......

..........

..............

...................

........................

So I knew the diagnosis, immediately, but still wanted to cast a broad net in case I was wrong. I ordered a CBC, BMP, Liver profile, VBG, Type and cross for 8 units, lactic acid, coags, CXR, blood cultures. I also had our charge nurse run down to obtain 4 units of emergency release blood. The nurses caring for the patient immediately placed 2 18g IVs in bilateral arms. The blood that returned from the IV was like nothing I had ever seen before. It had the appearance and consistency of watered down red cool-aid. 

I had a nurse call the charge to tell her we are changing the emergency release order to a massive transfusion protocol. I also asked that we not bother with the blood cultures, as this individual was going to need every single RBC possible. I had my medical student do a quick FAST exam to make sure we were not missing a spontaneous splenic rupture. His FAST exam was negative for obvious intra-abdominal free fluid. There was a large amount of fluid in the patients stomach. This patient was clearly having a massive upper GI bleed.

So ignoring the severity of this case how do we typically medically manage undifferentiated acute upper GI bleeds in the ER?

......

..........

..............

...................

........................

So there will be variance in practice, especially for the undifferentiated upper GI bleed; however, the most common therapies are proton pump inhibitors, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue), antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and pRBC transfusion using a transfusion threshold of hgb <7 g/dL.  

PPIs have no mortality benefit, but potentially reduce incidence of re-bleeding and need for surgical intervention in the management of bleeding peptic ulcers.^1 Given the lack of mortality benefit, PPIs are not a priority treatment in my practice, especially given that in the studies of the meta-analysis cited, PPIs were given after endoscopy. When they actually did study the timing of PPI administration (before vs after endoscopy), they found no difference in patient oriented outcomes.^2 It is also sufficient to give high dose PPIs (my typical dosing is 80mg of pantoprazole), rather than a bolus and drip during initial management, which in a case such as this is meaningful, as a drip means wasting a line on a drug that has no mortality benefit. I strongly suspected this was a esophageal or gastric variceal bleed, so I did not bother with a PPI.

Octreotide also has no mortality benefit, with its main benefit being a reduction of 0.7 units of pRBCs per patient it is used on.^3 The proposed mechanism for its effect is vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation so it should be reserved for patients where there is a high clinical suspicion for a variceal bleed. Typical dosing is IV bolus and drip (50mcg bolus, 25-50mcg/hr drip). Again, given the lack of mortality benefit, and in this case, taking up a line, this was certainly not a priority treatment in the massive upper GI bleed patient. 

Antibiotics for SBP ppx is one of the few therapies in upper GI bleeds (specifically cirrhotics with variceal bleeds), where there actually is a mortality benefit.^4 A third generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone is sufficient, typical dosing being 1-2g IV. I make sure to give all suspected cirrhotics (hx of significant alcohol intake, liver pathology, etc.) with an upper GI bleed a dose of antibiotics as this is definitely a priority therapy, although in this case, not as important as blood products. 

Transfusion thresholds of <7 g/dL for GI bleeds for the most part come from a single trial, the 2013 Villanueva trial. Here we found that a restrictive strategy for transfusion (7g/dL threshold) reduced incidence of mortality, bleeding, and adverse events compared to the liberal strategy for transfusion (9g/dL threshold). There was a few very important caveats to this study. The first is that every single patient in this trial received at minimum 1u of pRBCs. Per the trial's protocol, all patients received a unit of pRBCs prior to obtaining a hemoglobin level, and then received additional pRBCs if below their respective designated thresholds. The other caveat was that patients were excluded if they had a massive hemorrhage which was not defined and left up to the treating physicians.^5 This last caveat is important to remember, as a patient that is dying in front of you might have a Hgb of 8, but the liter of blood they just vomited might also have a hgb of 8, so recognize when you should deviate from protocol. This patient was obviously someone that would have been excluded from the trial.

**NOW BACK TO THE CASE**: VBG comes back with a pH 6.9, pCO2 20, HCO3 5, Lactic acid 45, and hgb was unable to be obtained. At this point I needed to make the decision of whether I should intubate or not. Intubating him would risk killing him due to any prolonged apnea time leading to near immediate death and being completely unable to match his minute ventilation on the vent and adding increased intrathoracic pressure leading to diminished venous return which would exacerbate his hemorrhagic shock. Not intubating him would mean gambling on whether he will vomit or not because if he vomits the contents of his stomach, there is a high probability he aspirates and dies, it also means I would be unable to place a cordis to assist in rapid transfusion due to how agitated he was. I chose to resuscitate him first rather than intubate. 

Another treatment I considered was tranexamic acid (TXA); however, the HALT-IT trial demonstrated a lack of benefit to TXA in GI bleed patients,^6 and I didn't want to take up another line for an ineffective treatment.

To assist with transfusion efforts, I placed bilateral IO lines in bilateral proximal humerus. While we were transfusing him, I got a call from lab that they could not run a CBC on him. Having experienced this before with low hemoglobin levels, I told them to report the results, as the sample was not diluted, it was legitimate. They stated they believed me, but the issue was that there was literally not enough RBCs to run a CBC. At this point I put out several calls to get some help with this patient including to our intensivist and on-call GI. The intensivist immediately came down to help with resuscitation so that I could discharge my other 3 patients so I could focus entirely on this one patient. Luckily I had 2 other ER docs on shift to help pick up the patients that continued to check in. It would have been a mess had I been by myself. 

Unfortunately, I realized who was on call for GI that night, and as usual with this one particular GI attending, he was of little assistance, stating ""well, if he is alive in the morning, I'll check on him, but it sounds like he needs to be resuscitated."" Of course, in his defense, this patient was sick AF, and to my understanding, current GI recommendations are to scope these patients within 13 hrs of presentation for high risk upper GI bleeds, and a recent NEJM trial demonstrated no mortality or transfusion difference in patients randomized to urgent vs early endoscopy (although this patient would have been excluded from the trial for being too unstable and would have received emergency endoscopy).^7 And unfortunately our IR docs will not perform TIPS unless GI has first performed an endoscopy first. 

I then get a call from blood bank that we are running out of emergency release blood (they only have 2u pRBCs left, as they used 20 units 2 nights before on another massive GI bleed), and they are unable to type the patient's blood due to not enough RBCs being present. At this point, the patient has received 4u pRBCs: 4u Plts: 4u FFP. I told them that we need to call around to get blood then because this guy still needed significantly more blood. I was then informed the patient's INR was >10 (important to note that INR levels are worthless for transfusion thresholds for FFP outside of coumadin use, and should not be used to guide therapy). This patient was receiving FFP not for their INR, but for balanced transfusion. 

The patient was now regaining a slight amount of color, his BP had improved to 90/50. This was now about two hours in, I decided that this was probably the appropriate time to take control of the patient's airway. I started the patient on peripheral levophed for the intubation, and drew up a syringe of epinephrine and diluted it to use as a push dose pressor. I made sure that we went straight from pre-oxygenation, to intubation rather than bagging due to the obvious risk of insufflating the stomach in someone with a massive amount of blood in it. The patient was intubated with the head of the bed at 45 degrees to reduce the risk of aspiration. I had our intensivist give a dose of the push dose pressor while I was placing the endotracheal tube. The intubation went successfully, thankfully.

The next concern was what to set the vent settings at. This was a patient that had extremely high minute ventilation prior intubation and still had a 6.9 pH, so we needed to try to match it as best we could. This is one of the few settings where I throw lung protective settings out the window and aim for higher tidal volumes. So I started this 5'3"" gentleman on 550mL tidal volume at a RR of 35 and advised the RT to repeat a gas in 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the intensivist placed a cordis so that we could expedite transfusion and placed an A-line. Nurses also placed an NG tube which put out 1.5L of blood.

We did draw slightly more blood for a repeat type and screen and CBC. His CBC came back this time with a hgb of 2.0 g/dL (the patient had 4.5 units pRBCs by this point). The patient was then whisked up to the ICU.

I spoke with the intensivist the next day. He ended up placing a Blakemore tube in the ICU as the patient deteriorated which was unsuccessful (I have very poor experiences with Blakemore tubes and find them to be largely useless, but that is a personal opinion). The blood bank ended up using the last of their emergency release blood on the patient, and prior to them obtaining more from surrounding hospitals, the patient coded and was pronounced approximately 10 hrs after he had arrived in the ER. They could not type and cross the patient due to almost all of his circulating RBCs being from donors. 

This was a very unfortunate case and there were certainly several less than ideal circumstances in this case that potentially could have lead to a better outcome in this patient, but in my experience, circumstances are almost never ideal.

Italian intensivists are circulating their experience with COVID-19. Their message: Get Ready!,"Dear Colleagues

Everyone is closely watching and monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak.  This global emergency is presenting major challenges for our profession as we attempt to anticipate, tackle and eventually get ahead of it. 

As there are many new experiences with this type of virus, we need to learn from those with more experience.  Information is vital.  As you will have seen, Northern Italy is in the middle of a crisis and Lombardy in particular has been severely affected.   Our colleagues coordinating the emergency ICU response in Northern Italy have sent me the following message which they wish to convey to all our members.I salute all the work our colleagues are doing, globally, faced with this situation.  ESICM will endeavor to do its part to share accurate information and resources.

Wishing you all the strength needed in the coming months,

Yours respectfully

Milan, 4 March 2020

*Dear friends,*

*At this moment in time, we believe it is important to share our first impressions and what we have learned in the first ten days of the COVID-19 outbreak.*

*We have seen a very high number of ICU admissions, almost entirely due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.*

*The surge can be important during an outbreak and cluster containment* *has to be in place* *to slow down virus transmission.*

*We are seeing a high percentage of positive cases being admitted to our Intensive Care Units, in the range of* ***10% of all positive patients***\*.\*

*We wish to convey a strong message: Get ready!*

*We also want to share with you some key points from our experience:*

* Get ready now - with your ICU’s networks - to define your **contingency plan** in the event of an outbreak in your community
* Don’t work “in silo”. Coordinate with your hospital management and other healthcare professionals to prepare your response
* Make sure your hospital management and procurement office have a **protocol** in place about **which personal protection equipment (PPE) to stock and re-stock**
* Make sure your staff is trained in **donning and doffing procedures**
* Use **education, training and simulation** as much as possible
* **Identify early hospitals** that can manage the initial surge in a safe way
* **Increase your total ICU capacity**
* Get ready to **prepare ICU areas** where to cohort COVID-19 + patients - in every hospital if necessary
* Put in place a **triage protocol** to identify suspected cases, test them and direct them to the right cohort
* Make sure you **set clear goals** for care with the patients and their families early on

*With our best regards*

"To those of you entering the profession or working your way here, the art of medicine is more important than the science of medicine","There is no doubt you will be well educated and well trained in the science of medicine. Statins post stroke, pneumovax to reduce lung abscesses, CAR-T for cancer, but I want you to start focusing on the human condition. This is not an exhaustive list by any means but is a start at how we should think of our fellow humans. I’m a hospitalist so I will try to only speak to what I know. Other specialties feel free to add.

Alcohol is not a problem. It is a solution to a problem. Don’t get frustrated that the alcoholic won’t stop if we don’t help with the problem.

On hospital day three of their pneumonia admission, your ten point review of systems is a lie. I propose a ten point review of who they are. Knowing who they are can sometimes give you better insight to their illness and sometimes just make the relationship stronger. Example, my dying cancer patient loved Texas hold em, playing a couple hands on day 20 before he died was more important than any ROS, exam, or meds I could give him.

Everybody around you is unique with their own anxieties and problems. That person who just got off the elevator, they might have just lost their newborn. That person who slammed the bathroom door might have just found out their spouse has cancer, that angry nurse might have a kid with special needs at home, that person holding up the cafeteria line might have just been told that their partner has Alzheimer’s. Be kind to everybody, the hospital is a very special place.

Don’t turn your back to the patient and type. Don’t stand up hovering over the bedside. Don’t not give silence a chance. These things are way more important than an S3. 

Don’t overvalue the risk of death. Specifically speaking about PEGs. Sometimes it’s ok to accept aspiration if death is not valued over eating. Better yet, don’t villainize vices at the end of life.

Opiates treat pain but cause suffering. Unless you are dying. BZDs cause way more anxiety when you try to remove them than the anxiety you were trying to treat in the first place.

Don’t lie to your patients. If they don’t take their asa, they won’t die. Learn how to couch it better or analogize it better. The odds are in their favor if they don’t take asa, but if they didn’t take it and got an MI would they regret it? Then it’s a discussion about regret mitigation. Whatever their choice, you’ll both be less frustrated and they will feel more respected and you will get more respect. Don’t lie.

Short of physically assaulting you, any abuse you get from patients or families is usually not personal and is the expression of the vulnerability and fear. Do stand up for yourself but give them the benefit of the worst of ourselves when dealing with the betrayal of our bodies.

Your career is an ongoing prospective trial with an n of one. Your value is standing up for the 95% of your practice that you can back up with your own well reasoned decisions. Don’t be dogmatic. 5% of your value comes from the margins of cognitive dissonance. If you don’t look, you will never see.

You are the right person for the job.

Last but most important. On death. We all die. We don’t all die the same way. Sometimes we die slowly on a vent and suffer to give our family the time to come to peace. Sometimes we take chemo for regret mitigation other times because we want our kids to know we didn’t quit even though we know we are dying. Sometimes our lives are robbed in the night and our families never get to say goodbye. The discussion around and about death is the most nuanced discussion you will ever have. Put your values aside. Ask questions and listen. Their motivations for delaying death are sometimes very meaningful and understandable even if you don’t agree with it. Don’t place the burden of removal of life support on the family, it’s not fair. Love and fear cannot hear reason.

The day you have no anxiety walking through those hospital doors is the day you hang it up.

Edit1: none of this is to say 95% of our job is not science a delivery of sound and safe practices. It’s in the margins of our job where science doesn’t explain the humanity of us all that we strive to excel and are called upon to deliver compassion. For the health of our patient yes, but also, more importantly, for our own health.

Edit2: my take on the abuse of residency isn’t a justification of other docs shitty behavior towards residents. If we accept the reality of shitty people and focus on learning how to face it we will have trained more resilient physicians. If you get humiliated during morning report, GOOD, take inventory of your ability to present and the holes in your knowledge. But it isn’t  advice to not stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself doesn’t always mean going toe to toe with a curmudgeon, sometimes you stand up for yourself by being a better version of yourself. I have worked with all kinds of attendings, the ones with pure animus are far and few between. But on the wards in a high stakes environment tempers will fly. Again not at all advocating for the abuse of another human being. I am advocating for the training of resilient human beings facing incredible odds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/d4ard6/to_those_of_you_entering_the_profession_or/,2019-09-14 20:44:30,tanda

How to deal with lack of empathy to Covid-19 patients?,"Self explanatory post.

Dealing with the current surge has been very difficult.

I have no empathy whatsoever to covid-19 patients during this current surge.

I used to early in the pandemic and before the vaccine but now I feel nothing.

I still treat them well, practice the standard of care medicine and wish them improvement but deep inside I can't care less if they actually make it or not.

If they deteriorate? Oh well tough potatoe. You chose this. You did this to yourself. No one to blame for your own suffering but yourself.

I hate feeling this way but I can't help but feel resentment for them filling up our hospital, taking beds from other sick patients and wasting resources that shouldn't have been wasted if they took the damn vaccine.

Update:
I really appreciate everyone's input.

When I rounded on my patients today I actually felt less resentful and more sincere and wishful for their recovery.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/p70nx6/how_to_deal_with_lack_of_empathy_to_covid19/,2021-08-18 21:27:38,tanda
In Defense of PSA Screening,"Urologist here and I wanted to provide you with the most up to date information on prostate cancer screening. I'll give the quick TLDR version up top, then go much more into depth down below.  

**TLDR: I believe that we should be offering PSA screening (every 2-4 years) for men aged 50-70.**

**The best available evidence suggests that with 16-18 years off follow up  you will prevent one death from prostate cancer and 2 cases of metastatic disease for every 110 - 500 men you offer screening to, and 7-18 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (not necessarily treated) to prevent one mortality**

This compares favorably to mammography (number needed to offer screening to prevent one death 370-950 depending on when you start screening), colonoscopy ( number needed to offer screening \~870 to prevent one death), and low dose lung CT (number needed to screen 320)

Going just on clinical data, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis has doubled since the USPSTF recommendation, and prostate cancer mortality rates have plateaud despite the invention of pretty impressive new therapies that extend life (novel hormonal agents like abiretarone, enzalutamide, etc)

The long version:

There are 3 main prostate cancer randomized screening trials. The PLCO (American trial), the ERSPC (European multinational screening trial), and the Goteborg trial (Swedish PSA RCT), which is somewhat confusing because part but not all of their data is included in the ERSPC trial.

When the USPSTF made their Grade D recommendation for prostate cancer in 2012, we only had the 10 year results from PLCO and ERSPC to go on.  The problem is that is at 10 years from randomization, not from prostate cancer diagnosis. Average length of diagnosis was only 5 years. The natural history of prostate cancer is such that almost all people will live > 10 years after their localized prostate cancer diagnosis, and most will live > 15 years. As such, the PLCO trial showed no difference in Prostate cancer mortality's while the ERSPC did show a mortality reduction, but you needed to offer screening to 1300 people and diagnose 49 people to prevent one death.

  We also now know these studies are incredibly flawed. In the American study, the PLCO, over 40% of men had PSA screening before the trial.  Of those who were screened and recommended biopsy, over 40% didn't comply.  And more impressively, **there was actually more PSA testing done in the control arm then the PSA screening arm**. This occurred because the trial took place in an era where PSA screening rapidly caught on from being a novelty to being standard of care. Unfortunately, it makes the results more or less worthless

The ERSPC trial also had some of these issues but to a lesser extent. Pre screening with PSA ranged from 1-40% depending on the site, biopsy compliance was higher (85%), screening in the control arm was still a big problem (up to 60%) but much less then in the PLCO.  Even with these caveats, the 16 year follow up data that released from the ERSPC showed that you needed to invite 570 men to screen to prevent one death and diagnose 18 men. Furthermore, the benefit was amplified on men who actually followed protocol. For the screening arm as a whole, the mortality reduction was 21%. For those who got 2 or more PSA tests, the mortality reduction was almost 50%. This data (the number needed to screen) will continue to improve as longer follow up occurs, as most of the prostate cancer mortality is likely yet to occur.

Interestingly there is a sub-analysis of the ERSPC, the Dutch cohort. This was the initial site in the trial, and as such has the longest follow up, the lowest rates of PSA pre screening (only 1%) and the lowest rates of PSA contamination in the control arm (only 6%). They found a 58% reduction is PCSM with a number needed to invite to screen of 101 to prevent one death, and **you only had to offer PSA screening to 67 men to prevent once case of metastatic prostate cancer**. The main limitation is that this was in a small sample size by screening standards (1100 men)

But wait, there is more.  The Goteborg trial (RCT in Sweden) also had much lower PSA pre-screening and PSA contamination then in the ERSPC trial. They found at 18 years follow up you needed to invite 190 men to get a PSA screen to prevent one death. Looking at men who actually got screened, you had to get 139 men PSA screening to prevent one death.

**While the data varies somewhat between the study, an interesting finding is that the better the study (longer follow up, better compliance, lower contamination) the better PSA screening looks. That suggests the benefit is greater then the ERSPC trial suggests.** 

As a Urologist I obviously have a bias here and stake in this fight, but it is also because I see the downsides.  Mortality benefits aside, even the quality of life burden of metastatic prostate cancer (it loves bones) is immense. We are already seeing a dramatic rise in metastatic prostate cancer incidence , likely due to the USPSTF decision. And while the data has evolved since then, the conversation hasn't seemed to.

Take home points:

**PSA screening in appropriate patients (men aged 50-70) saves lives at equivalent or higher rates then any other cancer screening, though there is a cost of increased diagnosis of indolent prostate cancer.**

**The mortality benefit is not going to be seen for > 10 years, so do not screen men with a <10 or even 15 year life expectancy,**

**Since these trials have been run, there have been some key changes.** 

**First we now recommend surveillance (and not treatment) for low risk prostate cancer. This helps us maintain the benefit of PSA screening while minimizing the treatment burden (though there is still a burden of surveillance in how we follow these men)**

**Second we now have the technology of prostate MRI prior to biopsy. This has been demonstrated to improve detection rates of higher risk prostate cancers, and actually reduce the detection rate of low risk prostate cancer. This is likely to reduce the number of cases needed to diagnose to prevent one life and may amplify the mortality benefit, but this remains unproven.**

**Third is we now have better treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer. It is unclear what effect this has on the benefits of PSA screening, as it may extend the natural treatment history of prostate cancer, but also improve outcomes in those who receive local therapy, so the impact here is unclear.**

Edit: this last point is also key from a cost benefit standpoint. The novel hormonal agents are great drugs (effective, well tolerated, etc.) but extremely expensive. The cost of a novel hormonal agent (abiretarone, enzalutamid, apilutamide, darolutamide, etc) is approximately 100k/year. And most patients will be on them for a median of 5 years. So in the last decade, metastatic prostate cancer has gotten exceptionally expensive, and the cost benefit of preventing one case is massive. 

**PCPs. Please screen your patients!**

"Finally able to speak to spokesman from UAPD (Physician's Union), here's what I found out","Long post, so buckle up.

I posted awhile back about making some surveys so doctors can anonymously voice support for prospective unions at their hospitals. Before I did that, I wanted to speak to the UAPD spokesman myself, so that I can help walk any interested physicians through the process without having to reach out to the UAPD directly until they have something a bit more solid to show for. We talked for quite awhile and he walked me through the process, complications, and what kind of ""extracurricular"" work would be required to form one (spoiler: not a whole lot on an individual level). It's against sub rules to post surveys here, so I will post those only in other medical subs. Physician's that contacted me & UAPD earlier will be contacted directly by me, and once again to them especially, thanks for taking direct action to end the trend of us getting stepped on.

I will list the key findings that I think will be high-yield to actual physicians, who can form actual unions. Ask away with any questions, I'll answer as best I can. And please, do yourself and your profession a favor and have these conversations with colleagues you trust as the Corona mess winds down a bit near you, and then take steps to formally unionize. That's the only way things get better. Do not act on hospital administrators' behalf by refusing to *act* on your own behalf.

Note: I am a dumbass med student, not a lawyer, not a union spokesperson, or anything else like it. I have also paraphrased in some places because the legal stuff is a rabbit hole and a half, though I will clear up nuances in the comments as necessary.

----

# Which physicians can unionize?

* Private practice - cannot unionize; doing so would be racketeering

* Public employee physicians (e.g. work for university hospital) - generally can, with varying restrictions on details by state law

* Private hospital employee physicians - essentially always can 

Laws governing unions are mainly provided by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and various similar state laws. The group of people that are eligible to unionize together form an Appropriate Bargaining Unit (ABU).

**Very important: to enjoy NLRA protections, you must be a union member. You cannot just hold an impromptu walkout. This is a crime, or at least grounds for board sanctions, since you will have abandoned patients.** Unions strike, individual just up and walk out.

-----

# Who makes makes up an ABU (i.e. who is eligible to join)?

Per NLRA, employees that form *functionally* the same role for the same employer make up the ABU. Keep in mind through-out that these laws were written for factory workers, not doctors, so view all of this through the lens that those same laws will be applied to us.

* hospital MD/DOs - obviously they're in the doctor's union

* doctors in the same city, different employer - need a separate union

* doctors at different hospitals, same employer - could go either way legally, there are factory examples of both; ask yourself if it makes sense for the negotiations to apply to both hospitals' doctors

* doctors with same employer, different city - likely need separate unions; e.g. cost of living likely differs

* NP/PAs at same hospital - likely to be eligible

* RNs, CNAs, PharmDs - likely need a separate union

* part-time doctors - likely eligible

* locums doctors - likely eligible

* MD/DOs in clerical or management roles - uneligible if they're more administrative than clinical

* those damn neurosurgeons I hate consulting - definitely eligible, suck it up

There are laws that allow multi-departmental (e.g. MD/DO + RN) or multi-employer unions, but this more complicated, and often involves mergers of existing separate unions.

-----

# Why eligibility matters

* **30% of the labor force (ABU) must sign an ""authorization card"" to allow the union-to-be to take action to legally force the employer to recognize it.**

* The % of the ABU that has signed auth cards directly determines the strength of union, and how likely UAPD is to prioritize forming your union (note: you do not need 30% before contacting them, see below).

* If you assume the size of your ABU and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) disagrees, that could put you below 30%

## What UAPD wants

* ~10 interested doctors that are on-board to contact UAPD, and to discreetly talk to more MD/DO/PA/NPs to get them on-board **(that is essentially your biggest time committment)**

* Any information you can glean about the size of your physician/midlevel workforce

  * info about full-time vs. part-time vs. locums is helpful

  * this is why I'm trying to make surveys

* an ""organizational flowchart"" outlining management structure from floor managers to CEO; they recommended asking a manager about this one (this is what MBAs get off on doing, so it likely exists)

-----

# Ain't no NP/PA joining my union

In short, too damn bad. Swallow our pride for our own good.

1. **Legally speaking, they perform the same role as physicians. You could not convince the NLRB that employed welder's apprentices are not production workers just because they require oversight, so you likely can't convince them that NP/PAs aren't allowed in the club either**

2. If you were to choose to not let them in, they would still be in the denominator of the 30% you need (i.e. you're less likely to get enough to unionize)

3. more people = more power. If you refuse to let them in, you're shooting your long-term prospects in the foot for short-term smug satisfaction

4. When you try to legally declare the union, or later on to strike, the hospital will just hire/give raises to the NP/PAs that you kept out of the club.

5. **There is nothing saying that their equal vote guarantees equal status/pay.** When the union negotiates, the welding apprentices don't get paid like welders. Hierarchies can be worked out in union negotiations *once the union exists.*

-----

# Legal Steps to Declare a Union

Items in italics are legal requirements, everything else is how UAPD runs things.

1. imagine an estimated 1000-person workforce (scale for your hospital)

2. The 10 interested doctors contact UAPD, hopefully with the materials discussed earlier (if you can get them)

3. They tell each to doctor discreetly recruit 4-5 eligible members. Report back when you have 50.

4. This process repeats, until you have 550 members (55% of ABU- they do this to ensure *30%*). UAPD is contact to help manage issues the whole time

5. **They set up offices near you and draft legal documents preparing to declare the union**

6. Ideally during this time, you've all managed to get 650-700 people (no less than 550) willing to *sign authorization cards. Then you do so.*

7. *UAPD contacts NLRB*, at this time the hospital will likely become aware of prospective union, and panic

8. The employer will do anything to invalidate the 30% before the vote. Hire lawyers, run smear campaigns, offer to make concessions if physician's tear up their cards or vote no. They often attempt illegal acts, too: bribery, threats, you name it. **Do not back down, do not concede. As a rule, if admin is scared, it's because you're winning.** Record (check state laws) all conversation or get it in writing. Threats/bribes should be reported, and are grounds for suits.

9. *NLRB orders a vote*

10. *If 50%+1 of voters are in favor, the union is legally in force. The NLRA now dictates what admins can (not) do. Negotiations begin.*

-----

# Oh God don't stop, I'm almost there

It gets better, *big boy.*

* They can no longer fire you.

* They can't change anything up for negotiation that was previously in force: your pay, your hours, your super secret physician's lounge amenities (stripper pole, or so I'm told)

* They are forced by law to negotiate with you, they can't go elsewhere to hire

* They can't refuse to negotiate - no ""take it or leave it tactics"" *by law*

* everything is up for negotiation, even the type of soap in the bathrooms

-----

# What about what we want?

* Once agreements are made with admin, it must past a 50%+1 union vote to become effective (salaries, hours, patient loads)

* This means not everything may fit you 100%, but IMO this beats negotiating for yourself, at an informational and tactical disadvantage

* On the flip side, that means that if UAPD reps are convinced you're getting a good deal but you don't buy it, nothing can be shoved down your throat without passing a vote

* You cannot be forced to sign a union auth card, nor be forced to join even if it passes vote

-----

# Dues

* UAPD is 501(c)3, so they subsist off of dues

* In right to work states, union members cannot forced to pay dues unless a Collective Bargaining Agreement is voted into effect

* They are legally required to provide members with documentation of how dues are spent

* **Dues = 0.9% of gross monthly salary** ($75/mo ($900/yr) for every $100K of yearly gross salary)
 
  * This is low, so I'm told, since doctors make more (and thus pay more) vs. other industries.

  * I checked this myself. In other industries, it seems like common dues are 1.2-2.5%

  * Nat'l Nurses United/California Nurses Association requires the equivalent of 2.2 hours of pay per month

    * Take your yearly pay in thousands, and divide it in half. This is your equivalent hourly rate working 40 hr/wk, 50 wk/yr (e.g. $100K/yr = $50/hr)

    * In the RN union case, they ask for 2.2 hrs of pay per month, or 26.4 hrs/yr. Since that standard work year is 2000 hours, that means the nurses union requires 26.4/2000 = *1.32% of gross salary, paid on a monthly basis*

That's all I have to start. Please lob questions ad lib, there's a lot I didn't cover, and I'll answer whatever I'm capable of. Please have these conversations with colleagues. All of our talk here only matters when we act on it. If anyone is interested and wants more info, or gets some people together and wants a bit of guidance as you prepare to reach out to UAPD, PM me and we can talk privately. **UAPD wants to see 10 interested people. If you can manage that, they'll shoulder much of the burden from there. That's all it takes to make it to start to make it real at your hospital.**

Remember: this may be the one time in our lives/careers and where we have public sympathy, open evidence of administrative overreach and mismanagement, and broad physician consensus that the status quo must change. Do not let it pass quietly by. If you try, and it goes nowhere, you've wasted several hours. If you don't try, and the moment passes, you have the rest of your career to wonder what might have been.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ggemrk/finally_able_to_speak_to_spokesman_from_uapd/,2020-05-09 12:29:58,tanda
Am I being selfish?,"Created a throw away account for this one. I'm a family physician in a large US city where I am one of just two physicians who speak an uncommon African language. As a result, 99% of my patients speak this language and about half are refugees. Both me and the other guy are no longer accepting new patients. I am really grateful that my services are needed, my patients are grateful that they can express themselves to me in their native language, but I'm burnt out by the fee for service model. I have adjusted my practice to fit this model, but I feel like 75% of my brain during the visit is trying to conclude the visit, bill for it, and move on to the next patient before I'm late. When I'm addressing a patient's problems, I feel a mix of reward because I am solving their problem, satisfaction because know nobody else could be giving this level of care, gratitude for their trusting me to address their problem, but there are also threads of frustration and resentment that the visit is dragging on. I feel like the system is built to force me to water down the care just enough to complete the tasks and then get the patient out of there. And this is obviously negatively impacting the visit for me and the patient. No complaints from patients so far, but it sucks to feel that I'm hurrying them out the door.  I can't lower the ammount of patients I'm seeing for financial reasons - I earn as much as my peers, but I'm seeing more patients to get there. I live in a modest house, drive a 10 year old car, but have medical school debt. 

I dream of doing a DPC model or concierge care where I'd have more time, like 30-60 minute visits. But no matter how cheap I make it, it's still more than free for my refugee patients. And I think my feeling is that medical care shouldn't be this thing that is made to be as cheap as possible. We deserve care that is not hurried.... I could easily convert to a DPC practice, I've worked out the mechanics of it, etc, but I can't ignore the fact that it would leave all these patients to be forced to do visits with interpreters (lets face it, it sucks for both physician and patient). Essentially by definition, I'd be excluding patients who need my care the most. And if I do a hybrid model, there is still a big chunk that will be pushed out and I don't even know how I'd make the decision to see one person or the other.  Having my fee for service patients leave by attrition is also a bad way to do it in my oppinion.  In summary, I feel like I'm being forced to choose between delivering hurried care at an exhausting pace or kicking patients out of my practice who won't be able to get similar care. I'm sure many of you have been in a similar situation and I'd appreciate your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/lpv82j/am_i_being_selfish/,2021-02-22 18:04:04,rewa
"Hydroxychloroquine works for COVID-19, trust me!","It seems like the goalposts for proving that hydroxychloroquine is beneficial continues to move.

First they showed it inhibits Sars-Cov-2 in-vitro, but obviously we know that doesn't necessarily translate in-vivo

The initial study that showed its benefit wasn't well controlled and randomised.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549

And when we did do randomised controlled trials it showed no benefit.

[RECOVERY TRIAL](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR2vg7IV5MhTS_gH4QXERwFJN03wS7fREdb0QB11NBfbYsg4nvR4qVKja7M)


People have also suggested combining it with azithromycin or zinc but there was still no benefit.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2019014 (With azithromycin)

Only retrospective studies have been done for zinc



And then we found that the numbers needed to harm vs save was too high due to risk of lengthened QT interval.

But people still insisted on using it very early on it the illness which still didn't work. 

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207


And then using it as prophylaxis which is just stupid as it's basically akin to moderate strength chemotherapy. And it still didn't work.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.20197327v1

So really, where else is there to go with this drug? It's been proven ineffective multiple times over, harmful in some cases and we've actually found other things that can work like steroids and anticoagulation.

For a drug whose mechanism of action is still not fully known, a lot of people sure do put a lot of faith in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/iyckyh/hydroxychloroquine_works_for_covid19_trust_me/,2020-09-23 15:43:35,goa

Help! A doctor in my hometown was kidnapped by the police and tortured.,"Well, here goes nothing, I hope this gets at least some visibility so doctors outside of Mexico find out what it's like to work here. I'm afraid it'll be a long post since I couldn't find any news in English, I'll link to a source in Spanish at the end if someone would like to read it first-hand. 

Dr Azucena Calvillo works with critically ill COVID patients at the ICU in a public hospital in Durango, México; last Friday she left her job at around 8:30pm and her family lost track of her. Local medical colleges started sharing her data and a picture in case anyone saw her or knew anything regarding her whereabouts. Later that same day we found out she had been taken by the local authority; they put her in a safe house and tortured her, then she was imprisoned without a trial.

Medical Colleges now nationwide started raising their voices and she was released and thankfully is now home; however, she's still being charged with attempted murder, at least she's not in jail anymore... 

They're accusing her of trying to murder a magistrate who was under her care in the ICU under mechanical ventilation, suffering from severe COVID-19. The prosecutor's office claims she came into the hospital outside her work hours and tried to shut off the man's ventilator, but the alarm went off and she ran away. We're talking about a 34 year old female internist who's been battling this disease for more than 9 months, putting herself and her family at risk, with a spotless record. 

They claim to have video evidence of her leaving the room, and her car being in the parking lot at that time; however all you can see in the video is someone clad from head to toe in PPE, impossible to even determine with full certainty that it's a female. Off this evidence she was taken without a warrant into police custody, due to legal reasons they've yet to reveal how exactly she was physically tortured, but what we know for sure is they threatened to kill her, her husband who is a nurse working in the same hospital and her daughter if she didn't sign a confession, or if she dared speak about what happened.

Why her? No clue, apparently she had a recent argument with the magistrate's sister who's also State Delegate of Tamaulipas Social Security Institute (IMSS), basically a very influential person. Apparently that was her mistake, antagonising someone powerful.

So that's basically it, I tried to keep it as short as possible, if you want more details or you can read Spanish here's a [link to the story](https://elpais.com/mexico/2020-12-09/el-caso-de-la-doctora-acusada-de-intento-de-homicidio-contra-un-magistrado-con-covid-acumula-interrogantes.html)

Hope this gets some visibility, because it's a terrible situation.

Edit: Sorry, not health secretary, was a mixup on my part she's IMSS' delegate

Edit 2: UPDATE: All charges have been dropped, but now it seems no one is responsible, so the colleges are still pushing for consequences for those involved in the kidnapping; it's all real shady, but at least now she is not at risk of losing her freedom again. Thank you everyone for your support and your interest in the matter. Apparently protests will continue, I'll keep you all updated

"Testimony of a surgeon working in Bergamo, in the heart of Italy's coronavirus outbreak","«In one of the non-stop e-mails that I receive from my hospital administration on a more than daily basis, there was a paragraph on ""how to be responsible on social media"", with some recommendations that we all can agree on. After thinking for a long time if and what to write about what's happening here, I felt that silence was not responsible. I will therefore try to convey to lay-people, those who are more distant from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these Covid-19 pandemic days. I understand the need not to panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening is not out, and I still see people ignoring the recommendations and people who gather together complaining that they cannot go to the gym or play soccer tournaments, I shiver. I also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After this epidemic, it will be hard to start over.

Still, beside the fact that we are also devastating our national health system from an economic point of view, I want to point out that the public health damage that is going to invest the country is more important and I find it nothing short of ""chilling"" that new quarantine areas requested by the Region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is purely personal opinion). I myself looked with some amazement at the reorganization of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities interrupted, intensive care unit freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid infections. All this rapid transformation brought in the hallways of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we did not understand, waiting for a war that had yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity (I open a parenthesis: all this was done in the shadows, and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).

I still remember my night shift a week ago spent without any rest, waiting for a call from the microbiology department. I was waiting for the results of a swab taken from the first suspect case in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the hospital. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening. Well, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind. The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. One after the other, these unfortunate people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let's stop saying it's a bad flu. In my two years working in Bergamo, I have learned that the people here do not come to the emergency room for no reason. They did well this time too. They followed all the recommendations given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out to prevent contagion, but now they can't take it anymore. They don't breathe enough, they need oxygen. Drug therapies for this virus are few.

The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can't take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let's face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease. Now, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sicks, of different colors depending on the department they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical procedure, there is the diagnosis, which is always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Now, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy.

Because that's the difference (now I get a little technical): in classical flu, besides that it infects much less population over several months, cases are complicated less frequently: only when the virus has destroyed the protective barriers of our airways and as such it allows bacteria (which normally resident in the upper airways) to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing a more serious disease. Covid 19 causes a banal flu in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it invades the alveoli of the lungs directly, and it infects them making them unable to perform their function. The resulting respiratory failure is often serious and after a few days of hospitalization, the simple oxygen that can be administered in a ward may not be enough. Sorry, but to me, as a doctor, it's not reassuring that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least a pill for high blood pressure or diabetes.

I can also assure you that when you see young people who end up intubated in the ICU, pronated or worse, in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the lungs to hopefully heal), all this confidence for your young age goes away. And while there are still people on social media who boast of not being afraid by ignoring the recommendations, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits have ""temporarily"" halted, the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.

The cases multiply, up to a rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the to use to emergency room EHR and a few minutes later I'm already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The screen of the PC with the chief complaint is always the same: fever and respiratory difficulty, fever and cough, respiratory insufficiency etc ... Exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All needs to be hospitalized. Some already needs to be intubated, and goes to the ICU. For others, however, it is late. ICU is full, and when ICUs are full, more are created. Each ventilator is like gold: those in the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity are used and the OR become a an ICU that did not exist before. I found it amazing, or at least I can speak for Humanitas Gavazzeni (where I work), how it was possible to put in place in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more. Those wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?"" or ""leave that admission to me, i will take care of it."" Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, schedules.

Social life is suspended for us. I have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day after a night shift, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have voluntarily not seen neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I'm happy with some photos of my son that I look at between tears and a few video calls. So you should be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are infected. You can go there without a rush. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work), put it on. Don't look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently recommended in view of their almost ubiquitous running low. Oh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain protection devices, many colleagues and I are certainly exposed despite all the other means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues also have infected relatives and some of their family members are already struggling between life and death. We are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away.

Tell your family members who are elderly or with other illnesses to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please. We have no alternative. It's our job. Indeed what I do these days is not really the job I'm used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal. I don't spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly. And we're not even heroes these days. It's our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of someone's blood we don't even know if they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know they have HIV or hepatitis C; when we stick ourselves during an operation on a patient with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit all day long for a month. When we read with anguish the results of the blood tests after an accidental needlestick, hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn't matter if they are beautiful or ugly, we just take them home. In the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too, though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share and share the message. We need to spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.»

Typical day in the COVID unit,"A lot of people have been asking me what it's like being on the COVID wards in the hospital, so I figured I'd share what a typical day looks like for me:

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Pharma gave me. Softly weep as it doesn’t put a dent in my medical school loans

6:30am - Make breakfast, using only foods from the diet that gives me everlasting life by avoiding all fats, sugars, carbs, and proteins. For details buy my book and check out my shop.

7am - Get to work, load up my syringes with coronavirus before rounds.

8am - See my patients for the day. Administer the medications that the government tells me to. Covertly rub essential oils on the ones I want to get better.

9:30am - Call Bill Gates to check how 5G tower construction is going, hoping for more coronavirus soon. He tells me they’re delayed due to repairs on the towers used to spread the Black Plague. Curse the fact that this is the most efficient way to spread infectious diseases.

10am - One patient tells me he knows “the truth” about coronavirus. I give him a Tdap booster. He becomes autistic in front of my eyes. He’ll never conspire against me again.

11am - Tend to the secret hospital garden of St. John’s wort and ginkgo leaves that we save for rich patients and donors. 

12:30pm - Pick up my briefcase of money from payroll, my gift from Pfizer for the incomprehensible profits we make off of the free influenza vaccine given every year. 

1pm - Conference call with Dr. Fauci and the lab in Wuhan responsible for manufacturing viruses. Tell them my idea about how an apocalypse-style zombie virus would be a cool one to try for the next batch.

2pm - A patient starts asking me about getting rid of toxins. I ask her if she has a liver and kidneys. She tells me she knows “the truth” about Big Anatomy and that the only way to detoxify herself is to eat nothing but lemon wedges and mayonnaise for weeks. I give her a Tdap booster.

2:45pm - Help the FBI, CIA, and CDC silence the masses. Lament the fact that I can only infringe on one or two of their rights. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow.

4pm - One of my rich patients begins to crash. Laugh as I realize I’ve mismatched her spirit animal and zodiac moon sign. I switch out the Purple Amethyst above her bed for a Tiger’s Eye geode. She stabilizes. I throw some ginkgo leaves on her for good measure

6pm - Go onto YouTube and see coronavirus conspiracy videos everywhere. Curse my all powerful government for how inept they are at keeping people from spreading “the truth”

6:10pm - Go onto Amazon and see that a book about “the truth” is the #1 seller this week. Question the power of my all powerful government. Make a reminder to myself to get more Tdap boosters from the Surgeon General next time we talk. 

7pm - Time to go home. Before I leave, sacrifice a goat to Dr. Fauci and say three Hippocratic Oaths.

9pm - Take a contented sigh as I snuggle under the covers made of the tinfoil hats of my enemies, realizing that my 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency training have been put to good use today.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York,"Day 4

“The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.”

I’ll start off with what is good.

We’re becoming more adept at treating COVID cases. With a growing census of confirmed COVID positive patients (10 COVID positive in a census of 16 today), we’re getting a better sense of how this bastard virus behaves. There are the easy presentations: 40F w/ no significant PMH presenting w/ a 7 day hx of fever, dry cough, fatigue found to have bilateral ground glass infiltrates, elevated LFTs, lymphocytopenia and even fucking hypokalemia on admission. Might as well not even swab to confirm. (But the ED will, oh yes, because now they’re swabbing everyone and costing us probably 30-40 PPE kits per admission while we wait the 24 hours for the COVID test to result.)

But then there was the subtle one: 73M w/ multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed with simple CHF exacerbation and sepsis secondary to a UTI (positive UA and UCx) who was tubed on arrival to the ED, admitted straight to the ICU, found to be COVID negative 3/21. He is taken off the vent within 24 hours and discharged to the floors. Because he’s COVID negative you see. We treat him with antibiotics, work up his NSTEMI which he managed to throw in during his first day admitted and kind of take mild interest in his recurrent fevers. But he’s not coughing and is satting well.

Yesterday, my team and I thought “This guy has a normal white count, elevated LFTs and recurrent fevers. Forget the last test, order a repeat COVID.” I do this several hours before speaking with the attending physician. During table rounds, he pointedly asked me if I was aware of the protocols the Command Center had put in place for repeat testing. I say no, as these protocols change every day. (Side note: N95s are now rated for indefinite use, not just 4 days. Hope we didn’t toss all those other ones away for no reason!) “Cancel the test, let’s get Infectious Disease on board and ask them their input.”

I put in for the ID consult, I... ""forget"" to cancel the COVID repeat or inform the Command Center. Busy day as you saw from yesterday. Comes back positive. *We know what this bastard virus looks like.*

But we spent 2-3 days in his room without our N95s on.

We would have spent more in there had we not tested.

We’re still early, but we know how fast or how slow a case progresses. Our younger patients, the 41F and the 49M might get discharged to home quarantine as early as tomorrow! They’re not reliant on supplemental oxygen and haven’t had fevers for >24 hours. Our older patients aren’t as lucky. No one on our census so far has been intubated. The 73M whose COVID we caught late rapidly progressed to requiring supplemental oxygen and was transferred to the SICU as the last stop before ventilator land.

We’re getting better as a team of residents. We’re all more than a little scared. I’ve talked to my favorite resident / current carpool buddy / best second-in-command about my anxiety about this situation. How the adrenaline kicks in when I’m on the floors and makes me feel less afraid and more focused. The crash after work is awful and the anxiety kicking back in takes a drink or two to knock down, but fuck it, I’m better at my work when I’m not terrified.

Oh and the food remains the best part of the day. Thank you, local places that sent great sandwiches for lunch and Greek for dinner. Makes the rest of this easier to write about.

Now on to what’s not good.

The hospital is now greater than 2/3rds COVID cases. The ratio of ventilators for COVID patients to non-COVID patients is 7:1.

We’re maxed out on the capacity of our Intensivists, intensivist PAs, and Anesthesiologists. The sprawl of the traditional ICU has taken over essentially anything that used to be elevated care and we’re still scrambling for beds. A handful of Internal and Family Med Hospitalists are being recruited to act as lieutenant Intensivists overseeing the ventilated. I mean lieutenant in its original definition: ""substitute,” “deputy,"" literally ""place holder."" They report to the Intensivists directly.

At lunch today, it was declared that due to the sheer number of Rapid Responses and Codes, and due to the overwhelming census of the Greater ICU, Residents responding to Rapid Responses are not expected to get any Intensivist backup.

I’m no stranger to Rapid Responses. You hear the call over the PA and are given a floor, you rush upstairs and enter a room blind with someone either choking, or unconscious, or bleeding, or seizing, or with a heart rate incompatible with life. You remain calm, you ask the patient questions while asking the nurses to give a summary of the patient’s medical background, current admission issues, latest changes, vitals, labs, imaging. Scary, but doable.

During the meeting, the Medical Director said the Hospitalists would be asked to run Code Blues. The Hospitalists balked.

See, Intensivists ran *every single Code Blue* in the hospital before now. One Hospitalist said, “We haven’t run a Code since residency! The residents should run the Code Blues, they’re probably better trained than us.” The room of a couple dozen full-blown-attending Hospitalists nodded in agreement. I was the only resident there, too stunned to speak up. No final decision was made.

I know the timing of Epi pushes and ACLS algorithms enough that a couple days’ review would cement it pretty well. But the actual pressure of making the call for a defibrillation or a push of atropine or adenosine is so beyond what I’m emotionally prepared for.

CPR is a violent, ugly thing with a fatality rate that is 100% for COVID patients with lungs too full of fluid for their heart pumping to matter. Even if I were to run everything perfectly, the person is still going to die. Let alone if I make the wrong call.

I’ve come to terms with the idea that I’m going to see COVID patients die under my care *a whole fucking lot.*

I don’t want to be forced to watch them die under my care from three feet away while I make a series of life or death decisions that are guaranteed to be utterly pointless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 5

“If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE”

“Usually takes about 20 minutes, then everyone’s arms get tired”

If this hospital is at war, it’s ceding territory at an alarming rate.

Here’s the layout of the field: we’ve got medsurg wings on the cardinal points of the compass (except 2SW for some reason) in a somewhat random pattern from first floor to fifth: 1N, 2S, 2SW, 3N, 3E, 5E, 5S. The ICU, CCU, CICU, and SICU are floating around the periphery of the 3rd floor.

By the time I started Day 1, 2SW and 5E were already on lockdown and designated as COVID territory. My team alone had a total of two pending and one confirmed COVID cases.

By Day 2, the CICU became a conflict zone and joined 2S and 5E. 5 COVIDS or pendings.

By Day 3, my team had pending tests in 5S as well. 6 COVIDs or pendings.

By Day 4, the 5th and 2nd floors were entirely given over to COVID. 3E still had some non-COVID evacuees waiting to be transferred to the last bastions of 1N and 3N. Everything ending with -CU is overrun by this point.

It’s Day 5. My census stands at 15, of which 9 are COVID positive. There’s talk of clearing out 1N sooner or later even.

The hospital is fairing less well: of the 170 or so inpatients (not counting the 25 or so Greater ICU COVID positive people on vents), 100 are COVID positive, and a third more have pending tests.

…

So those are the numbers. Actually walking the halls puts the change from Day 1 to Day 5 in starker contrast.

The amount of PPE used per nurse or CNA has steadily increased. On any floor (except the Last Bastion wings), if you squint your eyes all you can see is uniform green paper scrubs with blue hairnets and and blue paper booties and blue paper masks +/- an N95 underneath. If you look further down the hall you’ll see a spray of yellow as one of them gowns up to enter a patient’s room. (The nurses have been using Sharpies to write their names on the paper gowns so people can tell each other apart.)

Maybe you’ll spot a Resident in a long white coat rush by.

And by every single door on wheeled tables usually topped with hospital food are boxes and boxes of blue gloves and yellow gowns. Might be my imagination, but the boxes of face masks are disconcertingly not as ubiquitous.

The Greater ICU is less colorful. Just window after window of people on vents. Walk the whole length of it and count maybe one person who’s conscious. Most don’t look like our usual ICU clientele of the cachectic elderly. These are mostly men (my imagination?) ranging from their 50-70s.

I made the mistake of asking who the youngest intubated COVID patient on the unit was.

Younger than me.

So we finish at the ED. It’s not chaotic like a Saturday night. Sure there are a few beds in the hallways, but that’s nothing new. I walked the length of it too. Some people on oxygen here and there, wider variety of ages.

Lots of people getting gowned up to enter rooms though. And I know we’re supposed to take them off at the door of the patient’s room, why are people walking around-

“HEY! If you’re going to stroll around here, you’re going to need full PPE. With an N95 on!”

The ED is now considered COVID home territory.

…

I don’t feel like a soldier. I don’t feel brave for showing up to my job. I most certainly don’t feel like a hero.

I feel like the tide came in way too fast and now I'm staring at waves from below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 6

“There’s another Anesthesia Stat. Don’t know where we’re gonna put that one.”

55M with PMH of uncontrolled DM2, HTN, CKD3. Admitted 5 days ago for fever, SoB, dry cough, you get it. COVID positive on Day 1. Went to a COVID medsurg floor, experienced worsening hypoxia on NC, and started on nonrebreather. By Day 5, transferred to the newest territory grab of the Greater ICU, the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit - the PACU. We’re not doing surgeries anymore, so no anesthesia, so that’s free real estate to park the intubated.

One other thing. The PACU was never meant for anything longer than a few hours’ stay and has only drapes between beds. No doors or walls means this is COVID home turf. You have to completely PPE up to even enter the unit.

This newest long walk of ventilated COVID patients is kept alive by 2nd string equipment. No modern touch screens, no real time graphs, just an aged-beige box with some dials and digital-clock-red settings. It does the same job - you can set the PEEP, FiO2, RR, AC/PSV just as precisely as the modern machines.

Even the third tier stuff never intended to serve as ventilation for the 10-14 days of ventilation COVID patients may require works well. These are the surgical ventilators the anesthesiologists used to use back when we did surgeries. They have been liberated to serve the Greater ICU. We’ve even drafted the ad hoc ventilators of the local community of outpatient docs to act as reserves.

Code Blue called on the 55M gentleman above. The team rushes up and I am deeply relieved that it’s not a Code I have to run. By the time we get our PPE on (takes about 3 minutes), he’s already being intubated. No chest compressions required. We put in some orders, we watch the Veteran Attendings tube their first patient of the day. It is only about 8AM.

”Anesthesia Stat to the ED” heard on the overhead PA means someone is getting intubated essentially right after they enter the door. The Intensivist sighs and wonders out loud where they’re going to place this next patient on a vent.

The Greater ICU is quickly becoming The Empire of the ICU as more unused departments get swallowed up by the need to house the intubated.

...

I try to comfort myself with knowing I'm still living in the *good* days, relatively speaking.

No one on the hospital staff is sick. No one on my team or Residency program is sick. I'm not sick. We still have beds and ventilators, at least for the time being.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York (#11-13),"Day 11

“…unless it’s ’visibly soiled.’ Like we could *see* Corona.”

&#x200B;

I’ve been known to flirt with the LD50 of caffeine, but this morning I’m slipping it some tongue.

I’m status post two pieces of 100mg caffeine gum and a cup of coffee by 6:30AM. I hit 70 on the back roads heading towards the hospital in the minutes just after sunrise. There are practically no other cars around. My AirPods stream Andrew W.K.’s “Ready to Die.” A tasteless choice, sure, but it fits the energy of the day so far.

The 73M with multiple comorbidities who developed an NSTEMI, and who tested positive for COVID 4 days after testing negative has steadily been declining in the SICU. He’s refusing his medications despite his seasoned ICU nurse using the full spectrum of asking, demanding, and sternly admonishing him on his nonadherence. She even broke out the fake tears, she told me. She doesn’t do that for everyone. But no dice.

More importantly he’s doing poorly on a nonrebreather (NRB). If he takes the mask off, his sats drop to the 70s, a value you might guess correctly to be incompatible with life. He’s a little altered and he’s been put on dilaudid and a wrist restraint. Just the one, a CVA left the left arm safely useless.

One of the interns asks me what the plan was for our patient here.

“Palliative has a Goals of Care meeting with his family today. Our only plan is to keep him alive long enough for them to sign the DNI/DNR.”

I can blame the caffeine, I can justify it by saying his prognosis was *dire* and it’s reasonable to think we did all we could, but I scare myself a little with how low my empathy’s dimmer switch is set.

But I don’t know how else to deal with this. The recommended treatment guidelines changed, yet again. Azithromycin is now actively *counter*\-indicted for COVID patients. We take him off it. Steroids, which as of yesterday were counter-indicated for COVID are now the standard of treatment for all patients on NRB. We start him on Solu-Medrol 1.5mg/kg divided BID. For all the good that will do.

He’s also well past the 5 days of Plaquenil / hydroxychloroquine. You know, that drug that was supposed to solve this whole crisis?

We all remember that right? I’ve got photographic proof we used to believe it would work.

Take a look at the March 17th (or Day -5, if you’d like) *National Enquirer* cover:

>**CORONAVIRUS**  
**CURES**  
**FINALLY**  
**FOUND!**  
>  
>*Warning! Surgical masks* ***SPREAD INFECTION!***

Take a look at *every single intubated patient’s* medical orders and you’ll see they either completed or are on Plaquenil and azithromycin.

And people *still* think we have any handle on this other than jamming tubes down throats and waiting.

No one will believe the history of this thing when it’s over.

The patient passed that afternoon.

His daughters had signed a DNI/DNR right before.

…

I’m reminded of an intro Stephen King wrote for one of his books, where he writes about fear:

>*""The shape is there, and most of us come to realize what it is sooner or later: it is the shape of a body under a sheet. All our fears add up to one great fear, all our fears are part of that great fear - an arm, a leg, a finger, an ear. We're afraid of the body under the sheet. It's our body.…And \[the writer\] takes your hand and he enfolds it in his own and he takes you into the room and he puts your hands on the shape under the sheet… and he tells you to touch it here… here… and* here\*…""\*

A quarter million Americans (*at least*) are going to become bodies under sheets in the span of one or two months. And we’re talking about returning to work and a “miracle” ending to this in nine days.

Wake up and feel the corpses.

*^((PS: Yes, I owe Stephen King a royalty check given how much I crib his writing style.))*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 12

“I will continue using military metaphors. We are at war with this virus.”

&#x200B;

The greetings this morning were grim.

“Stay safe” has become the *aloha* of intra-Resident conversations. I heard that twice before reaching the front doors of the hospital by 6:50AM.

“How was the night?” is the standard greeting to the two Residents just finishing their 12 hour Night Float shift. These are the two young MDs left to put out fires across half the hospital’s two hundred or so non-ICU beds.

“We had the longest Code ever. Took an hour. We went through maybe 20 epi’s.”

Epinephrine is only given to people with either pulseless electrical activity or those who are asystolic – flatliners. (Once again, Hollywood has lied to you. You don’t put the paddles on anyone with a monitor next to them going **BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP**.) The ACLS guidelines say you push epi every 3-5 minutes.

The *Ok, We Tried* alarm should have gone off about 3-4 epi’s in. Not 20.

“Was it a young guy?” “No, It was John.”

I curse a little louder than I mean to. I walk out of the room and wash my hands even though I’m sure I hadn’t touched anything.

John is- *was* a nurse at my hospital. He *was* maybe in his early 50s. Every Resident loved him because he was tough and always fought for his patients. He was a nice guy and a pleasure to work with. But he was fierce. He’d seek us out during Rounds, stare us down and make sure we put in orders for his patients ASAP. We all respected him.

I knew he was on a vent as of the night before with settings that looked, well, *dire*, but it’s still a shock.

The night team leaves. I start mindlessly updating the cheat sheet summary of our 16 patients. I’m on autopilot at this point. 13 are COVID cases. COVID cases are, unfortunately, very easy to manage. You put in orders for medications that you’re pretty sure don’t work, you note how bad their oxygen saturation is on nasal cannula (NC) or nonrebreather (NRB), and you gown up and see the worst cases / people you think might need to be intubated in the near future.

The first Rapid Response comes at 7:40AM. I reach the door (of course it’s a COVID room, that’s all we have left) and realize I left my N95 at home. I’m not entering that room. I flippantly tell the interns to assess the situation and head to pick up a new mask at the Command Center.

The nice nursing admin lady hands me a paper bag with a new N95. She tells me to sign for it in the binder just outside the door. Despite my autopilot brain, I joke, “Oh we’re on the honor system? You know I’m just going to sign ‘John Smith’ in the binder right?” She laughs and says it’s ok I left my N95 at home.

I take my mask and sign John Smith in the binder.

Just because I’m in shock doesn’t mean I can pass up a joke like that.

I head back up to the Rapid. I get a debrief that this was narrow complex ventricular tachycardia in the 200s. They pushed metoprolol (wrong decision) and adenosine (right decision). I go talk to the very bright and hardworking intern on my team. I explain that in situations like this where the patient is otherwise hemodynamically stable, metoprolol isn’t going to do enough to slow the heart rate. You’ve got to reset the circuit breaker. I asked who the attending was in the room.

There was no attending. The intern had to make the call.

I left my interns to the wolves when I walked off in a huff to go get a new mask.

My autopilot brain goes over how shitty I am of a senior Resident. *When YOU were an intern, at least your seniors never walked away from a Rapid.*

As I walk back to the call room to barricade myself behind a door for an hour or so, I come upon a nurses meeting where the news of John’s passing was being announced. I honestly don’t remember a single word of it. I do remember the occasional sobs coming from these amazing women.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

Table Rounds.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

I’m getting good at assessing whether or not a hypoxic COVID patient will get tubed and if we have time to get them upstairs before they crash.

Go me.

…

*“The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.”*

I worry that some of my fellow Residents will break in the near-future.

It wouldn’t be a big break, just a small one that makes you sob on the way to work and dread every new day. For what it’s worth, so long as no one in the residency program gets sick, I don’t think I’ll break. A few of us are close though.

It‘s the Night Float’s birthday today. Which means she technically coded John for 60 minutes on her birthday in the pre-dawn hours. When she tells me this, we tell social distancing to go fuck itself and hug for a while. I offer to take her shift and work a 24, but she declines.

The possibility, the *comfort* of breaking feels like it’s hiding just over the horizon waiting for us.

It’s what follows that Hemmingway quote which worries me.

*“But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”*

John never broke.

He was good, and gentle and brave. And he was killed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Day 13

“Where do you want dad to die? Paralyzed on a ventilator or not?”

&#x200B;

Quiet day. Got time to take stock of everything.

The hospital is housing somewhere around 250 patients including the regular floors and the Empire of the ICU, >90% positive COVID. My team’s census for tomorrow is 100% COVID. There’s talk about transferring the few remaining COVID-negatives to the USNS Comfort.

Oh, and yesterday some moron tried to crash a train into the USNC Mercy on the West coast. Because we’re dumb, panicky animals.

45 COVID cases on vents with a dozen or so vents available. A little over 60 people currently on nonrebreathers.

We're still 5 days from peak hospitalizations and 6 days from peak fatalities per day.

Personally, I think I’m holding up as well as I can. Writing has helped. Occasionally get some exercise in. Plan on going for a long walk tonight.

I’ve got 6 more days of scheduled inpatient care left. Two weeks of vacation after that. I’m thinking about signing up to do COVID swabbing since it pays well and I’d go nuts if I weren’t doing something.

I still hate the idea of treating this as a war, but I’m thinking about volunteering to be “redeployed” to another hospital elsewhere in the States once New York gets past this. The rest of the country is only a week or so behind. New fronts are opening up. I’m pretty well experienced in managing COVID cases at this point.

3 More Days of Inpatient Care in New York (#14-16),"Day 14

“Alright we’re done.”

&#x200B;

I wonder when we’ll need a refrigerated corpse truck trailer.

Before my shift officially starts, at 6:50AM, a Code Blue is called. 90F w/ dementia and probably a long list of other comorbidities is found essentially cold and dead when the day shift nurse first walks in the room at the beginning of her shift.

Because mankind is cruel and irrational, this lady whose last real conscious thought occurred several years to a decade ago is still Full Code. So half a dozen nurses and four doctors all gown up and rush into her room to break her ribs before she's officially pronounced dead.

Because we're doing *everything to save her*, don't you see.

I swear to Christ I'm not this heartless when I'm the outpatient Family Med doctor I was supposed to be.

By the time I find a gown (a lovely, blue plastic trash bag of a gown which makes me sweat profusely and leaves my back slick with sweat and my gloves full of sweat and I pray we get those breathable yellow paper gowns again) then put on my eye protection and gloves and enter the room, the attending is already calling it quits.

The anesthesiologist asks if this patient (*this corpse*) needs intubation.

“If you want to intubate her that’s fine. If you want to put yourself through it.”

One push of epi.

There's no blood pressure, pulse was gone well before we got to work.

Time of death… who knows.

Does it matter?

…

I come back to my call room and look at the census. 22 patients, 100% COVID.

I scroll a third the way down the cheat sheet and see EXPIRED. At this point that just means alerting the attending of more paperwork to be done.

I round on all my patients. They're all miserable, can't catch their breath and have headaches. A very nice lady asks that if she and her husband are in the hospital, should her 90 year old mother who lives with them be afraid? The truth is if you flip a coin she's already infected. If she's symptomatic and needs to go to the hospital, she's got a good 1 in 5 chance of dying.

I neglect to tell her those odds. I tell my patient to call her mom, and that she should report any symptoms to her regular PCP.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID is intubated.

He was a younger guy, only in his 60s. He's got a chance.

Then table rounds.

Then there’s a Rapid and a COVID… isn't intubated.

88M w/ dementia plus many other things. He'd never make it off the tube.

We're here now. We're running low on beds and ventilators and the Tough Decisions are being made.

The ~~guidelines~~ the dictates of the Gods of the Empire of the ICU as of a few days ago were a patient could only be intubated if they were A) satting <90%, B) tachypneic >30RR, and C) prone when these were taken.

Now we're adding on if they've lived a life well into their 80s or if they've got dementia or if through ""clinical judgement"" you know they're hosed, then they won't be tubed.

It makes total sense.

I've had a few calls now where I've gone through the pre-written script for letting the typical patient's spouse of decades and decades know their world is about to end. How that soul they've nuzzled up against for comfort is close to depart since death is inevitable.

""Not a candidate for invasive intervention"" is the exact phrase.

Rationing? Cold calculation in an unprecedented time of suffering?

Truthfully, I'm thankful I’m not making these decisions.

Day 16

“Basically they wanted me to lie to the family. Say ‘we did everything we could.’ But we didn’t.”

&#x200B;

This is when things start getting bad.

Did I feel it when I walked in today? The shift in the air?

One of our patients, a lady in her 80s, has been steadily degrading, gasping for air on a nonrebreather for close to two weeks. Palliative was brought on board yesterday.

Palliative calls the patient’s husband. It’s documented right there in the chart: “Pt has living will expressing no aggressive measures including CPR and Intubation however her husband appointed HCP does not want to place limits. Call placed to pt's husband for follow up. He is unwilling to talk further than ‘I want my wife home.’”

Overnight, the patient remained febrile, 102.7F despite Tylenol and cold packs. Hypotensive, 50/20s. Agonal breathing. It’s a sight you won’t forget after you’ve seen it. The clinical definition is disturbing enough: *“…characterized by gasping, labored breathing, accompanied by strange vocalizations and myoclonus.”* ICU evaluates her and says she’s not a candidate for pressers, intubation, or CPR. But still, no DNI/DNR order is placed.

The Night Float calls the patient’s husband. He remains adamant that he “wants everything done.” Night Float is essentially told by the Emissary of the ICU to not even enter the room should she Code, then call up the husband and reassure him we tried our best.

There’s a piece of me that empathizes with the patient’s husband. He’s been married to her for who knows how long. He was probably terrified, in denial, and isolated.

But a bigger piece of me thinks he’s a *fucking monster* for extending his wife’s suffering explicitly against her prior wishes.

At 09:19, we get a call that she has stopped breathing. Code Blue goes off.

The nurse at the door says something about how she knows it’s futile but she didn’t feel right not calling the Code. Because FULL CODE and DOING EVERYTHING TO SAVE THEM is sacred. Or it was. Or something. I don’t know anymore.

I tell everyone the plan. “Two people and two people only in the room.” I point at my interns. “Stay outside.”

I put on my gown and gloves. Did I put on the stylish lab glasses I wear around my collar as an apocalyptic-chic fashion statement? No, I remember now. I kept my regular glasses on instead. Because a good 30 seconds into breaking this woman’s ribs someone else entered the room and put a plastic shield over my face.

But before that I asked for a backboard under the patient. She was wide eyed and dead but I still asked for it.

And before that I pointed at the clock and said, “In five minutes, at 9:26, we’re stopping the Code.”

I’m pretty sure I felt ribs pop in succession like a zipper when I started compressions.

I think it was only two or three minutes into the Code before the intensivist walked into the room. He asked the patient’s age (82) and if she had dementia (she did) and after learning so told us to stop immediately.

Time of death… who knows.

Does it matter?

…

I leave the room without making eye contact with anyone. I try to remain cognizant of my hands and the right way to take off my PPE without buying a metaphorical scratcher ticket for the slight chance of intubation or death.

My poker face must suck because I’m asked three times in a walk of 300 feet if I’m ok. (Not even poker face. It’s all covered with a mask. My eyes are giving me away.) A nurse, the Chief Medical Officer of the entire hospital, and the Medical Director of the entire hospital. They all ask if I’m ok. I’m not, but I lie.

I tell the truth to my patients and I lie to my colleagues and bosses.

The nurse who called the Code in the first place asks me if I’m ok as I’m walking out of (fleeing from) the unit. “Thank you, doctor. Thank you.” I can’t summon any words to respond. *Thank me for what?* is the only thought I have.

The Chief Medical Officer stops me and asks me if I’m ok tells me we’re going to have a meeting sometime today to discuss end of life issues.

The Medical Director asks me if I’m ok and sees right through me. He does his best to boost my morale.

He knows I’m a big fan of the food being offered to the Heroes of the Hospital (*I assure you I bitterly laughed while writing that*) and insists I go get some food. I half-heartedly say I had a piece of a donated heart-shaped Danish earlier, but he goes out of his way to physically walk me over to the Command Center where some breakfast burritos were delivered.

I appreciate this gesture so much. I’m just a little ashamed he had to spend time on me when he’s dealing with quite literal life and death decisions on an hourly basis.

I soft coded a patient and got a breakfast burrito for the trouble.

Go me.

*I soft coded a patient.*

I was protecting my team and the nurses and it didn’t matter if we put on pacer pads not or if we even tried epi and she was dead when I walked in the room.

"Essay from Josh Lerner, MD after the CDC loosens guidelines for all of us on the front lines","
“In one of the most vivid scenes in the HBO miniseries ""Chernobyl"" (among many vivid scenes), soldiers dressed in leather smocks ran out into radioactive areas to literally shovel radioactive material out of harm's way. Horrifically under-protected, they suited up anyway. In another scene, soldiers fashioned genital protection from scrap metal out of desperation while being sent to other hazardous areas.

Please don't tell me that in the richest country in the world in the 21st century, I'm supposed to work in a fictionalized Soviet-era disaster zone and fashion my own face mask out of cloth because other Americans hoard supplies for personal use and so-called leaders sit around in meetings hearing themselves talk. I ran to a bedside the other day to intubate a crashing, likely COVID, patient. Two respiratory therapists and two nurses were already at the bedside. That's 5 N95s masks, 5 gowns, 5 face shields and 10 gloves for one patient at one time. I saw probably 15-20 patients that shift, if we are going to start rationing supplies, what percentage should I wear precautions for?

Make no mistake, the CDC is loosening these guidelines because our country is not prepared. Loosening guidelines increases healthcare workers' risk but the decision is done to allow us to keep working, not to keep us safe. It is done for the public benefit - so I can continue to work no matter the personal cost to me or my family (and my healthcare family). Sending healthcare workers to the front line asking them to cover their face with a bandana is akin to sending a soldier to the front line in a t-shirt and flip flops.

I don't want talk. I don't want assurances. I want action. I want boxes of N95s piling up, donated from the people who hoarded them. I want non-clinical administrators in the hospital lining up in the ER asking if they can stock shelves to make sure that when I need to rush into a room, the drawer of PPE equipment I open isn't empty. I want them showing up in the ER asking ""how can I help"" instead of offering shallow ""plans"" conceived by someone who has spent far too long in an ivory tower and not long enough in the trenches. Maybe they should actually step foot in the trenches.

I want billion-dollar companies like 3M halting all production of any product that isn't PPE to focus on PPE manufacturing. I want a company like Amazon, with its logistics mastery (it can drop a package to your door less than 24 hours after ordering it), halting its 2-day delivery of 12 reams of toilet paper to whoever is willing to pay the most in order to help get the available PPE supply distributed fast and efficiently in a manner that gets the necessary materials to my brothers and sisters in arms who need them.

I want Proctor and Gamble, and the makers of other soaps and detergents, stepping up too. We need detergent to clean scrubs, hospital linens and gowns. We need disinfecting wipes to clean desk and computer surfaces. What about plastics manufacturers? Plastic gowns aren't some high-tech device, they are long shirts/smocks...made out of plastic. Get on it. Face shields are just clear plastic. Nitrile gloves? Yeah, they are pretty much just gloves...made from something that isn't apparently Latex. Let's go. Money talks in this country. Executive millionaires, why don't you spend a few bucks to buy back some of these masks from the hoarders, and drop them off at the nearest hospital.

I love biotechnology and research but we need to divert viral culture media for COVID testing and research. We need biotechnology manufacturing ready and able to ramp up if and when treatments or vaccines are developed. Our Botox supply isn't critical, but our antibiotic supply is. We need to be able to make more plastic ET tubes, not more silicon breast implants.

Let's see all that. Then we can all talk about how we played our part in this fight. Netflix and chill is not enough while my family, friends and colleagues are out there fighting. Our country won two world wars because the entire country mobilized. We out-produced and we out-manufactured while our soldiers out-fought the enemy. We need to do that again because make no mistake, we are at war, healthcare workers are your soldiers, and the war has just begun.”

Anonymous writings of a covid nurse,"“You a nurse?”

I glance up from my phone and look at the young man before me, dressed in a rumpled blue Kroger apron and khakis. He’s maybe seventeen, possibly a little older. It’s hard to tell these days with everybody wearing a mask. We’re left to judge those around us based on their eyes and build alone. The enthusiastic, carefree manner with which he’d been jabbering at the bagger next to him before he turned his attention to me gives him away far more than what I could glean from his appearance.

“I am,” I answer. I’m coming straight from work, still dressed in my navy blue jumpsuit and the classic black departmentally-approved jacket that has my name and hospital logo emblazoned on the chest. I’m hungry, exhausted, and sore. I just spent thirteen hours getting my ass kicked in full PPE. There’s *at least* a stage two pressure ulcer behind my ears that stings perpetually, serving as a constant reminder of the year we’re living through. On a normal day, I’d probably enjoy this little social back and forth. On a normal day, I’d love meaningless pleasantries like chit-chatting about my job. But right now, I’m just looking to score some stale fried chicken from the freshly closed hotline before I sink wordlessly into a scalding bath with a glass of wine.

His eyes light up. I can almost sense it coming.

“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen?”

I might feel offended if there was anything left in me capable of feeling. It’s a rude enough question to ask in its own right, but it’s especially awful timing during 2020. My colleagues and I are in the middle of a war. Or maybe it’s a genocide. Somedays it feels like the unending tide of patients will never stop, mounting higher and higher until the collective crush of humanity finally stresses us to our breaking points. Mothers, fathers, grandparents, uncles, daughters. They fill our beds up regardless of whoever they are to whoever brought them in. And yet the rest of the world keeps on spinning merrily along, intentionally oblivious. Throwing birthday parties, traveling to the beach, celebrating 12th anniversaries over steaks and bloomin’ onions at Outback.

What actually *is* the worst thing I’ve ever seen, I wonder? Despite the numerous times I’ve fielded this query, I’ve never truly stopped to think about it before. A number of situations spring to mind immediately, but they’re all oddly blurry through the lens of distant recollection. I can’t picture faces. I can’t remember names. Truth is, this young kid in front of me might have been on my assignment yesterday for all that I know. Once the time clock gives its telltale chirp that my badge swipe has been registered, I dump everything in my locker and leave…including memories. It’s just the nature of the gig. Very few individuals ever sneak their way into my synaptic clefts and set up permanent residence.

But today? Today is different.

This is one of the shifts that’s made a rare impression on me, like pushing your thumb into a memory foam mattress. I’m left with a little divot in my psyche. Even now, standing before the plexiglass barrier in this dumpy Kroger with the lackluster produce section, I can mentally feel that little hollow and know that somebody has moved in. No vacancies today, I’m afraid.

I had a full line of folks today, but only one of them was riding my nerves. Old guy. Not that it matters in my opinion. Nobody deserves to die like that regardless of age. Covid, of course. What else is there to treat these days?

He’d picked it up from his daughter, I guess. Contact tracing is mostly an exercise in futility at this stage. It doesn’t matter, anyway. The moment I laid eyes on him at shift change I knew that he was a dead man. It was written all over him in a language that every single healthcare worker is fluent in. The head-bob with every inspiration. The way his collarbones and ribs became prominent as he gulped for breath like a man drowning in nothing. The faint sound of crackles, like cellophane being crushed between your fingers. The restless picking at his covers, his gown, his oxygen mask, clawing them all off with whatever strength he could muster. For whatever reason, most people prefer to exit the world they way they entered it; clothed in nothing, helpless to the elements.

I replaced his oxygen mask and ignored the blaring saturation alarm desperately attempting to alert me to the fact that he was in danger. He was already on 100% oxygen. He’d long since finished his round of remdesivir and convalescent plasma, for all the good they’re worth. Short of forcing pure O2 into his lungs with a pressurized noninvasive ventilation system, there was nothing else to be done. He’d never tolerate a BiPap anyway. He’d have it yanked off in a New York minute and I’d be left scrambling in the hallway to get geared up and put it back on before he coded. If his family wanted him to be full care, I was going to have to tie his arms to his bed. Even then, it was blatantly apparent that he wasn’t going to survive. He would die alone, fighting in restraints, suffocating slowly until his light was snuffed out by a strand of RNA a mere 70 nanometers in diameter.

I paged his attending and told him that it was time for The Talk. You know the one. The one where we admit defeat. Throw in the towel. The one where we switch gears from healing somebody to ensuring that they’re dying well. “Okay,” he replied with a sigh. “I’ll give them a call. Watch for orders and you’ll know which way it went.”

It didn’t go the way I expected, but it did go the way I hoped. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw orders for morphine, ativan, and discontinuation of telemetry monitoring instead of serial ABGs, BiPap settings, and a stat chest xray. His futile fight was over. He would be allowed to exit stage left with a set of unbroken ribs, no tube expertly placed by a far-too practiced hand into his throat and threaded down until it reached his ruined lungs.

He finally went unresponsive and entered the actively dying phase about halfway through my shift, but I had the tools at my disposal to keep him comfortable. I pointed a fan straight at his face and turned it on high in the hopes that his brain would mistake the wind for breath. When he became air hungry, I had medications in my arsenal to keep him satiated. When he became anxious like a cornered animal, I had the tools to keep him calm. I turned the lights low. I brought in an LED candle and placed it on his bedside table. I pulled a chair next to him, held his hand, called his family and asked them what kind of music he liked to listen to. Old country, came the answer. Even though it was an exposure risk for me, I pulled out my phone and put my Spotify Premium account to good use. He won’t die alone, I promised them. I’ll be here. They thanked me for my kindness, my care, my compassion. They feel better knowing he’s in my hands, they say.

If only they knew that what *I* feel is nothing.

That's not a normal human reaction. It’s monstrous. *I’m* monstrous.

Who watches somebody die horrifically, far away from the people who love them, residing under every single isolation precaution we’ve ever developed a protocol for and has no emotional reaction at all? Who numbly performs empathetic actions solely out of the formulaic knowledge that it's the socially correct thing to do? What kind of nurse operates like this, anyway? We’re supposed to be the shining pillar of solicitude. We wrote the book on warmth and care. But, whatever a good nurse is supposed to be, I’m the antithesis of it now.

I'm an android masquerading as a normal person. I'm the Borg. A Geth unit. I feel like a computer crunching numbers on a spreadsheet, only the numbers are other creatures and I'm pretending to feel alive like them. Most days I’m thankful for the masks more for the physical distance it places between me and other people than the physical protection from illness. At least they can’t tell that what I’m demonstrating isn’t noble stoicism, but numbness.

Maybe this is self defensive. Maybe it's a trauma response. Maybe it'll all come back to me in a flood one day when this is all over and it'll bring me to my knees. Or maybe I'm just fundamentally broken as a person by everything I’ve witnessed this year. Maybe this is permanent.

I do recall that I used to feel. I used to cry with my patients when they received bad news, or genuinely cheer with them when they received good results. I used to celebrate every discharge as a small victorious moment in their lives and my career. I wasn’t always like this. I regret that I’m like this now, and yet I don’t know if I would change it even if I had the ability to do so.

I watched a man die today and felt nothing. And *that*, I think, is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.

But this kid doesn’t actually want to hear that. He doesn’t want to know the real stuff. He wants to be regaled with a glory tale. A story about how I once coded somebody and they farted with every chest compression. A quippy anecdote about some guy that “fell” on a cucumber that somehow mysteriously ended up in his rectal vault. It’s socially inappropriate to be honest and I don’t really care to be honest anyway. So I pause for a second before deciding what to say.

“Eloesser flap care,” I reply. “Had to pack a guy’s chest cavity twice a day with 26 yards of gauze. Every time I pulled the packing out it was like that old magic trick with scarves.”

He grimaces and laughs as his mask slips below his nose. He doesn’t bother to replace it. I don’t bother to remind him, because it changes nothing anyway. He has no perspective on what it’s like inside the halls of my hospital. He’s young and careless, even though he’s taken seventeen thousand selfies of himself in a mask to prove how conscious he is to Instagram. It’s just his nose anyway. Even if he gets it he’ll be fine, he thinks. And most likely, he’s correct.

It’s the nurse in front of him that isn’t fine.

Rough Day,"Edit: thank you all for your supportive words 🙏 I posted here with no particular expectation, but you all have had such kind things to say. I know others have had it worse than I have, but I am so grateful this community exists for me today and for others past and present who need a little pick-me-up and validation. I'll pay it forward whenever I can with myself and my colleagues.

Hey all. Wasn't sure where to post this, but /r/medicine seemed the most appropriate.

I'm a new anesthesiologist at a community hospital. We have not been crushed by COVID yet, but we're moving in that direction, and every day we're teetering on the precipice of at or beyond capacity. The policy in our shop is to have anesthesia do all COVID intubations if at all possible and there haven't been a ton of them to do so far, but we had a somewhat unexpected bolus today and I had a handful. Now, I'm usually pretty unflappable and can take a lot of stuff--I think a lot of us are, or were, before COVID--but one of the patients today really hit me hard.

He's an 80 year old with multiple comorbidities who's been steadily declining on increasing non-invasive ventilatory support. The ICU called us somewhat non-emergently understanding that the patient was definitely heading that direction. I go over there with a CRNA for extra hands, we PPE up, and start the preparations. The ICU doc is in there with us and does the procedural time out while we're setting up, but before we can get started the patient gestures around his hissing BiPAP for something to write with. He tries to say what he wants to say a couple of times, but the BiPAP is too loud and he just can't muster enough air to speak up over it. There's a bit of a scramble for pen and paper, and he just starts writing what we think are random words. One of the nurses pipes up and says, ""I think those are song names"", and the patient nods. Then he writes ""funeral"".

He was desperately scribbling the songs he wanted played at his funeral. He knew that he is likely to get worse, and that he may die--he explicitly told the ICU to keep him on the vent no more than a week, and told his family to hold them to it. He knew that this could be the last time his eyes close.

Then we intubated him and lined him up and went on to do the next one.

I don't think there is a way we go ""back to normal"" after all of this. There will simply be before COVID and after COVID.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/kxih8a/rough_day/,2021-01-15 00:11:26,morbi

Day 18 “You’re trying to save the world and I’m trying to save you.”

Premeditated. That's the word I'm worried about.

75M w/PMH of CVA, nonverbal, bed bound, resident of a NH. Presented w/ fever of 103F, found to be COVID positive. He was doing well this morning, only on 2L via NC.

While responding to a different patient's Rapid, my intern is called off to assess this guy. By 14:00 he was satting in the 80s. Started on NRB. She orders a CXR and a ABG. I return from the Rapid (60F w/ alcoholic pancreatitis, COVID negative, hypoxic, watched her get tubed) and take a look at the patient. Junky lungs on auscultation. Agonal breathing. Clearly. Despite the NRB and sats in the upper 90s, the guy looks scary. Scary enough that I think he's going to crash in the next 10 minutes or so.

He's Full Code, of course. Before he had been transferred to our service, Palliative had already been consulted. After a few days of unsuccessfully trying to contact the patient's only living relative (his daughter), she signed off on the case. No Goals of Care meeting for this man.

I don't want to Code him. I don't want my nurses or I needlessly exposed to a droplet bomb of a resuscitation that I know for certain the ICU would never accept. He won't get tubed, and if he's not getting tubed he's dead. He's dead regardless of whatever we try.

""Full Code, COVID positive. Probably going to have to do chest compressions."" ""Yeah. Limit the people in the room. Five minutes on the clock."" ""Then we'll call it.""

I didn't hesitate when I said that.

It wasn't a spur of the moment decision. I have thought over the previous Code and my decision then to limit it. And I'm repeating it.

God help me.

It doesn't sit right with me so I go to the medical director of the hospital (the very nice gentleman who got me a breakfast burrito, as you remember). I present the case.

""This is a big ethical dilemma."" He exhales with the same exacerbation I feel. He offers the choices of treatment as usual (CPR / maybe intubation) or possibly two attending doctors attesting could sign off that CPR/intubation would be pointless. He tells me to see the CMO.

I go to the Chief Medical Officer. I repeat the story. He's a good man, a pediatrician by trade. Used to do our 8AM peds didactics. He's on the ethics board. He chews over the ethics of the case for a while.

As much as the conversation about end of life was enlightening, I'll spare you the filibustering.

The CMO meets up with my team (fuck, I never meant for this to escalate like this). He again filibusters the ethics of the case. Ultimately, he chooses to write a note as an Ethics Consultation advising that if two physicians are in agreement, a DNI/DNR order can independently be made.

After he leaves, my attending: ""Once you make someone DNR yourself it's a civil case, but it can be a criminal case against you.""

We all agree that he has no chance of surviving the Code, and even if he magically made it to a vent he'd die from respiratory failure. Or the kidney failure. Or maybe heart failure.

The other attending, my program's inpatient director for the hospital and ""Physician of the Year"" also balks at signing the form. Because he's not involved in the case, you see.

My attending says he'll talk to the ICU attending to maybe get a signature.

""Don't call it a soft code. Never say the words 'soft code.' But…""

I won't write the rest of what he said because I respect the man too much.

I am fighting uphill to do the right thing. Or what I think is the right thing. I don't know anymore.

...

Before I leave for the night, I text my attending asking if he signed the DNI/DNR. He replies ""No. It’s a tough decision.""

As I'm walking out I tell the nurse handing off this patient to the night shift that he is still full Code. She's incredulous. She had put out that bright pink MOLST form right in front of the attending to make sure it was signed two hours ago.

""Why didn't he sign it?""

""Because he's a moral coward.""

…

I come home, watch *Westworld*, call up my best friend and weep.

Not the pretty tears of a Hollywood doctor overcome with their episode's brush with mortality who goes on to eloquently explain their sorrow.

No. It was ugly, wordless, choking crying.

Not for anything in particular. I couldn't say why today was the day I broke a little. Maybe a lot.

The only words I remember saying are ""*They all keep dying*.""

Day 19 The Story of Me

The absolute arrogance of you.

You thought you knew this thing. This *fucking monster*. And yeah, you caught and exposed one case. You could probably catch every case from 100 yards out at this point from just basic labs and an O2 sat even without a COVID test.

But you had no clue early on that this was EVERYWHERE. That this would spread so quickly and would overwhelm the census this thoroughly. The ED was right to start testing everyone who entered the doors and it wound up protecting you and your team.

And you denigrated them for ordering those tests. Day 4, it's there in black and white. And now your census is 100% COVID even if they came in for a fall. You wrote that on the same day as you proclaimed your mastery of this plague. Idiot.

You can manage the cases on the floor and order all the meds that whatever today's recommended shotgun approach to management has advised. You can know each and every single COVID patient's SpO2 and if they're NC or NRB by heart and it doesn't matter.

The monster causes DVTs even in patients on blood thinners. How many people did you admit that were placed on SCDs instead of heparin or Lovenox because their clotting score was essentially nil? How many people on Lovenox still threw clots? How many did you discharge home two weeks ago without a 30 day prescription for Lovenox? How many of them are going to die?

And the sudden deaths. You didn't notice a pattern in all those Code Blues? How pretty much all of them were PEAs? You coded a guy on the fucking floor because he dropped dead walking to the bathroom. How many did you send home are going to drop dead from *that*?

You advocated for a man to not receive CPR or be tubed like everyone else. *What do you possibly think gives you the right?* All you did was piss off your attending. Nothing changed. The patient will still end up getting Coded.

Every other doctor in the hospital is ok with pointless interventions, so why aren't you?

*You're not doing well*. And you want to forego one or two weeks of scheduled vacation to go volunteer for more of this suffering?

Your mentor got sick, and you could be sick. You already suspect you're an asymptomatic carrier like every other Resident.

Why stick with this?

The absolute arrogance of you.

…

But don't forget the good parts.

Don't forget going to an impromptu party you just had next door with your fellow residents.

Don't forget drinking Coronas and laughing with your friends.

Don't forget commiserating with them over this catastrophe.

Don't forget being open and honest with your interns and knowing they don't think you're an asshole.

Maybe you're doing a good job.

You can't get that Starfleet Medical tattoo on your left deltoid in Brooklyn right now like you wanted, but you will eventually. And getting a permanent reminder of those three red lines of split skin on your left 5th digit knuckle from washing your hands constantly would be a nice memento of this shitshow.

The eyebrow gash you got from that botched piggyback ride last night is pretty funny though.

Hugs and kisses,

"“Ok ok ok ok ok, one, two, three, four now PUUUUUUUUUUSH”","As all funny stories about residency begin, it started in the Intensive Care Unit.

I’m a recently promoted second year Family Med resident who’s earned the privilege of becoming an ICU orders-bitch.

Most of the job is a mix of data-entry and the equivalent of optimizing floral designs in a funeral home on fire. I mop up the charts, correct sodium and magnesium and potassium and phosphate levels on future corpses and immobilize and anesthetize the rest.

“Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his restraints renewed before this afternoon.” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his pain meds renewed.” “Mr \_\_\_\_ needs his diet orders advanced.” “Mrs \_\_\_ ’s NG tube needs an order.”

I loathe this rotation with every part of me.

I’m working a 24. Friday to Saturday, 7AM to 7AM.

The first twelve hours aren’t so bad.

The usual morning of catching up on a baker’s dozen critically ill patients’ charts, talking to the badass ICU nurses who tolerate residents like myself well enough despite our stunning ignorance.

Were I two floors below and two weeks past this hell of a month, I’d be a normal second year, PGY-2 sophomore lieutenant guru for the Interns on the inpatient teaching service.

Were I two floors below and not isolated from my friends, my job description would comprise of *Know the census, check in on the trainwrecks, maybe expedite a discharge summary if the kids are running late.*

Here I’m the idiot with a couple letters after his name trying to gain the favor of the Biggest ~~Pricks~~ Men on Campus who you go running to when the patient has the audacity to try to die on you despite your best protracted efforts.

So it’s still morning and I’ve set up camp on the furthest left terminal on the lazily curving row of desk space facing the 20 or so ICU sliding glass aquariums of the rapidly dying and essentially already dead. Ventilators, drips, and tubes galore of Frankenstein medicine buying time for some, prolonging suffering for more, and maybe, *possibly* saving the life of one.

As a doctor who normally communicates with the living, you cannot imagine how annoyed I am.

The day proceeds as normal these last three God-forsaken weeks: Look up and notice the intensivist has already begun rounding without so much as tapping me on the shoulder because it’s beneath him to acknowledge me directly.

We see the rest of the patients. There’s about 15 full minutes of teaching mostly punctuated with “…which you should look up” the way old telegraphs were punctuated with STOP. He says we’ll do an IJ later today. I decline the opportunity to personally take a scalpel to an octogenarian’s neck.

No one dies during the daylight hours. No discharges or downgrades either.

…

Night shift.

19:00, the overnight nurses come on and my next twelve hours get more interesting.

The wisdom of modern medicine has decreed that when treating the most fragile and complicated patients, the best person to take the helm from dusk to dawn is a second year resident running on equally lethal amounts of caffeine and dread. So I’m thrown the keys to the ward and now run the show.

Time to pay attention.

The census: your run-of-the-mill hyponatremia, a few multi-organ failures w/PMH of the everything with a management goal of, “Convince the son/daughter Mom’s dying this week,” and the remaining ones trying to take me with them.

The problem makers:

65M w/PMH of EtOH abuse, paroxysmal Afib, DM2, HLD, gout, found to have hyponatremia in the one-teens. Alcoholics are easy enough to take care of. Put them on CIWA protocol, squirt Ativan into their veins every so often, we’re cool. He’s only flipped out and saw a baby crawl up the wall once today and subsequently got well and truly snowed. We’ll be fine.

87F w/PMH of stage 4 breast ca w/ mets to lungs, GI tract, and brain, presenting w/ AMS. Hospital course significant for sepsis and multi organ failure requiring ICU stay w/ central line and HD. Basically a grandma with cancer of the everything, dead before she went through the sliding glass doors after it got too hard to breathe at home, but she’s still full Code.

I had a 30 minute discussion thirteen hours earlier about her prognosis with a series of family members handing off the cell phone from one to the next about continuing this futility of care. Bright pink MOLST form still went unchanged for this half of the shift.

63M w/PMH of schizoaffective disorder, HTN, HLD, came in with AMS and found to have a CMP which competed for “most number of values incompatible with life” seen by the hospital. H&P significant for a diet consisting entirely of *Chobani® Greek Yogurt - With Fruit On The Bottom* (blueberry, for the record) for the last three or five years.

Earlier in the day I got pimped on this patient regarding Refeeding Syndrome by the scowling, perpetually mildly perturbed Intensivist. I failed spectacularly and retreated to my furthest-left terminal to sulk while reading UpToDate.

And beyond how terrifying managing the few-groups-shy-of-a-balanced-food-pyramid case is, I’m also on the clock to catch a kid tonight.

Continuity delivery. She’s crowning at 2AM and I’m contractually obligated to catch her kid one floor down in the maternity ward.

…

27F G3P2 w/ no significant PMH about to pop. She’s one sprinting floor down the stairs. I’d been getting progress texts all night: station and dilation and effacement all now pointing towards *if you want credit to graduate, get down here immediately.*

There’s a rule in my Family Medicine program that in order to become an independent, grown up doctor, one must catch exactly five (5) or more kids whose mom the Resident has seen at least three (3) times for routine prenatal care.

I had seen Ms \_\_\_ well above three times for prenatal care and would not be denied my trophy.

Saw Mom since her first *you’re-sure-I’m-pregnant?* clinic visit. Was there the first time we picked up the kid’s heartbeat on the Doppler.

I’ll trade however much they pay to do a colonoscopy or a cath just to keep being around a happy mom’s experience listening to her next new kid’s first heard heartbeats.

The tocodynamometer’s peaks confirm the texts and I take note at the wails of this suffering, sweating goddess who’s now both parts future of humanity and possible minor surgical emergency.

My physician’s mind calmly regards my patient’s genitals leaking blood and shit and a baby’s crowning skull as something equivalent to an art piece recreation of the War In Vietnam and I assure you I don’t freak the fuck out at all.

Unrelated, most of my time before this was spent on checkups of healthy third graders or managing hypertension in otherwise healthy adults.

The Family Medicine Intern on overnight Obstetrics, Dr \_\_\_\_ and I stand shoulder to shoulder at the business end of a uterus so we can get both get credit for catching this kid. No time for booties for me, I’m lucky to have had the handful of seconds to put on a mask and splatter-resistant gown.

The L&D nurses and the Midwife play overenthusiastic cheerleaders at the crest of each contraction wave.

To be honest, they’re doing the majority of the work.

“***Push push push push push push*** annnnnnd **BREATHE!**”

They hold her hands, they help fight her agony.

Then, a miracle occurs.

…

I’ve been told this is one of the happiest moments of your life.

The culmination of so much worry, and want, and love on a level no one understands until they see the face of their first child the first time.

For me, Mom’s blood is puddling against my black Chucks and I’m dreading playing tug of rope with the afterbirth then shakily stitching Mom’s perineum / boink bridge flesh wound back together.

Labor for a Resident is so much more than just catching the kid.

Still work to be done even after the small triumph of not fumbling a newborn’s head onto the tile despite having zero training on playing quarterback to a hiked football covered in lube.

Labor stages have a second half after you’d think the shift should be done.

*Stage 3 of 4: After the baby is born, you continue to have contractions so that the placenta can be born.*

*Stage 4 of 4: The two hours after birth when breastfeeding can be established. Contractions continue as the uterus will shrink.*

I clamp off the umbilical cord twice a couple inches apart but neglect to milk the center of the tissue outwards.

Professional OB/GYNs, please don’t spoil the ending.

I create the anatomical equivalent of a pressurized blood balloon. Which I then proceed to cut, sharp end of the scissors directly anatomically inferior to my face.

A miniaturized Bellagio fountain spray of cortical blood unleashes upward, making a splattered streak of red from my right cheek to my glasses to my forehead to an already-red single curl of my hair to the fucking *ceiling*.

None of that is a lie, none of that is an exaggeration.

The cleaning crew had to replace a ceiling tile after my handywork.

The L&D nurses got a good laugh that pre-dawn.

I’m too punch drunk from lack of sleep to do anything but laugh along and think *of course*.

…

I take the stairs double step back up to the ICU.

I taper off the adrenaline rush for an hour checking in on my ICU patients’ charts. Everyone is still alive, no reports of toddlers tapdancing on the ceiling, Cancer of the Everything’s still breathing, Chobani’s labs are looking better. I crash in an unused ICU bed in the furthest possible left-most side of the unit.

Smells like plain hospital detergent and hospital plastic, feels like scratchy hospital linen and a flat hospital pillow. For all I care, might as well be like slipping into a warm hotel bed with a fiancé.

I’m vaguely aware of the electric bed inflating at odd places from time to time to save me from bed sores.

I awake to my phone’s alarm exactly one hour and seventeen minutes later for morning sign out.

"“Put your white coat on, look the part for this call.”","It’s night. Because it mostly happens at night for whatever reason.

Quieter at night, maybe. More somber, more empty. Would feel out of place to leave the room after and see sunrays through the glass.

You haven’t taken a call like this before. It’s ok, don’t apologize for waking me up to help you through it.

The simulations in med school were brief and more an intro acting class than anything. But I’ve taken these calls more than a few times. Just a few too many times lately, come to think of it.

Remember we’re participating in a ceremony, a very important ceremony. It’s essential we put on our vestments. Naked black scrubs and a lopsided stethoscope around your shoulders might be appropriate for the rest of the patients you’re madly dashing around managing. But let’s take our time for this call, even if it means taking ten minutes ignoring your cell as it gets hammered by pleas for 3AM stool softeners, sleep aids, and the occasional potential heart attack which 98% of the time is GERD or transient stable angina.

Our appearance is meaningless to the patient now, but very important to the family.

You ever been an altar server? Doesn’t matter. That’s about the only real training I had, other than on-the-job opportunities. I don’t mean the times I served *those* Masses, I mean being in front of an audience and serving as a symbol rather than a technician.

We’re participating in a sacrament. *An outward sign of inward grace.* It’s important that we show grace for these next few minutes. Because there’s only the smallest mote of diagnosis in these next minutes, but our actions will decide whether we become spite-worthy phantoms or mere background characters in this family’s memories.

Put on some gloves. Non-COVID, thank Christ, so we can at least keep the rest of our humanity bare despite the mask.

Let’s enter the room. I’ll make the introductions and perform the ceremony. All you need to do is watch.

Try to tune down the quiet sobs.

Not all the way, just don’t succumb to sobs yourself.

Use your most gentle voice. Look everyone in the eye, left to right, person by person as you speak.

“I’m sorry to interrupt you all. I’m Dr \_\_\_\_\_\_, this is Dr \_\_\_\_\_\_. We’re here to check on David, we’ve been told he’s passed.”

Use his first name, it shows one last shred of empathy despite the Very Important Initials after our names.

Because the next part becomes legal and lifeless.

*1 §1. \[Determination of Death.\] An individual who has sustain*   
*2 either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory*  
*3 functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions*  
*4 of the entire brain, including the brain stem, are dead. A*  
*5 determination of death must be made in accordance with*  
*6 accepted medical standards.*

In your softest voice, shake him (gently, please, this is theatre) by the shoulder and ask.

“David? David? David?”

He won’t wake up, but it’s important that you tried for the audience.

Now take your knuckles and rub them against his sternum. Hard. You’re actually checking for a response now, so you need to lay into it. You’re trying to cause pain to reveal life.

I won’t dwell on that last line.

But still, no dice. He won’t wake up, so now we get to cross our t’s and dot our i’s and whatever idioms no longer exist since we all type our words out in EMRs.

Listen to his non-beating heart with your lopsided stethoscope. Take your time, at least a minute. Ignore the five calls waiting for you, this is an important moment.

*If this is a corpsicle fished from a frozen river, you can’t pronounce them dead until they’re warm and dead, but you already knew that.*

*It’s funny what our medically-tuned brains focus on, isn’t it?*

Listen to lungs that breathed the same air as you 24 hours earlier and try not to feel small in their cathedral silence.

Look him in the eyes. This first time you’ll fight against it, subconsciously tear your gaze away to anywhere else, even towards the gaping open-jaw drama-mask frown, instead of those lifeless windows to an absconded soul. Take out your phone and turn on the flashlight and shine it into the stationary panes to confirm no one’s home.

Make note of the time of death. That goes into the record, you know.

“I’m sorry, but David passed.”

Sigh here. Just don’t cry. The rest of the family will take care of that for you.

“Thank you for being with him. He was very lucky to have loved ones near him when he passed.”

The pronouncement means *nothing*. Having initials after your name and blessing the dead and blessing the family who bore witness to this death means *everything* for this call.

*That* was why you were called.

The nurse told you the patient died when you answered the phone, and you will never second guess it because you know she’s competent and also it’s incredibly obvious what a corpse looks like after a 1 second glance for 99.99% of the cases.

We flash the initials after our name and wear the long white coat and sport the stethoscope and *this is what we do*.

We pronounce the dead.

…

I don’t know if there’s an inherent finite end to empathy.

Does the sparking fuse eventually run out and detonate leaving some wreckage of *mere* sympathy? Or does it lead to something far, far worse? *Gomers* and utter stoicism to suffering and death like *way* too many of the top elite of the hospital?

I only worry because when I’m alone with a patient who died, I go through the motions and I sincerely feel sorry for their passing, but at the end think: *By the power vested in me by this great state and nation I hereby pronounce you, dead.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/hl6vb3/put_your_white_coat_on_look_the_part_for_this_call/,2020-07-04 17:14:52,tanda
Are we tolerating the status quo too much? [Serious},"In today's medical culture, are we undervaluing physicians by tolerating the status quo?  The status quo of rising medical school costs, poor mental health, mistreatment in residency, broken technologies, inflated administrative costs, etc?...  We limit medical student postgraduate options to internship and residency, yet we graduate NPs and PAs to begin supervised practice with a starting average salary of $105,000.^([1,2](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/nnQn+Rhob))  Meanwhile, medical students graduate  unable to practice medicine without an internship (that pays an average starting salary of $56K.)^([3](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/DW0u)) I'm not arguing against physician extenders or residency. **I'm arguing against the status quo in medicine.** 

To be licensed as a physician in most states, you must complete a year-long internship.^([4](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/GKZv)) California is requiring multiple years of post-graduate training.^([5](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/KWbu))  Our status quo provides no in-between licensure options for medical students, while we are simultaneously graduating NPs and PAs into supervised practice. In 26 states, NPs can practice autonomously in their field immediately.^([6](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/g0nU))  Why are physicians that graduate from a US medical school and cannot match into a residency (for whatever reason) less able to practice medicine than NPs and PAs?  Is it just the status quo? 

Right now, of the medical student graduates who do not go to residency, some become scribes, MAs, and consultants. ^([7](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/1zpK)) Very few find research jobs, and even fewer gain a temporary license that allows them to practice at the level of a mid-level under the supervision of a physician like you can in Missouri.^([8](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/JJ9P))  So what are you, the physician, to do?  The Flexner report of 1910 gave us the gold standard of medical training for the time,^([9](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/qNBL)) yet we act like no future improvements are needed today.^([10](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/6v56)) 

If you're like me, you have some changes in mind.  I can list several improvements I'd like to see.  First, rising school costs are trapping students.^([11,12](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/zFeu+P40u)) Medical school graduates have, on average, $251,600 in debt these days.^([13](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/ggr7)) The debt doesn't disappear, either, for those who cannot match into a residency.  Medical schools are increasing tuition annually and federal loans accrue interest from the beginning.^([14](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/P50Q)) Why do we allow interest to begin accruing so many years before employment is possible, and why do we pay so little?      

Medical schools should aim to produce autonomous physicians, but not every graduate can achieve an internship.  What are they supposed to do? Physicians should create a ""supervision-required"" midlevel-style license for medical school graduates that haven't completed an intern year.  Otherwise, less painful routes to the top of medicine will continue to gain steam. Administrators need to fill gaps in their hospital systems with providers from somewhere, after all.  

We have a physician shortage, despite an increasing number of medical schools and residencies.^([15](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/fgme))^-([16](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/f8ym))  In fact, the total number of residencies available has increased at the same rate as medical school enrollment.^([17](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/FMlm)) However, in 2019 there were still 44,603 students competing for 35,185 PGY-1 spots.^([18](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/u0o7))  You have a huge discrepancy between PCPs and subspecialists, so applicants are unevenly applying to the higher-paying fields.  Also, IMGs are applying for US residency positions. 

Then there is the status quo of mental health crises among trainees and other physicians. Still, physicians and students commit a substantial number of suicides every year.^([19–23](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/MMMm+XOXG+2G4w+VDdC+9f6k)) That's not a fun fact. Perhaps you're like me and have known someone to take their own life.  Medical training and practice are toxic because of the high stakes.  There are board exams used as gatekeepers to certain competitive specialties.  You are often sleep-deprived and stressed. Not to mention, if you are careless then someone dies (no pressure). Also, healthcare costs are skyrocketing due largely to administrative expansion.^([24](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/bwu3))  Overall, there are fewer and fewer resources for physicians to utilize.^([25](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/HShL)) It's a tough environment right now.  We have to buck the status quo.

**You can** fix the illogical things we are doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing quality. Where to start?  Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses.  It just takes some common sense, optimism, and compromise. It takes all of us.

**Physicians need to get more active in politics.** Policymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement by you, the physicians. For example, we have 1,100+ EHR vendors, in 2020, that cannot communicate data between each other.  That is the status quo.  However, if forced to do it, I argue EHRs could share data.  How?  If policymakers mandated some standard changes to the requirements for all EHRs.  We would need to mandate the creation of a unique identifier that all healthcare providers use to find common patients, a mapping between coding languages, and a system to distribute stored data storage between systems.^([26–28](https://paperpile.com/c/cfDTYD/LV9u+oIpW+20oA))

**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to remember your leadership roles** in the hospital, the community, and beyond to seek progress.  Physicians need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen.  If we can do that, we don't have to worry about anything. The problem is, there are very few physicians with enough of a spine to stand up to the status quo.  Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked.   **You're not alone.**  We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  It's got to be the *physicians*.  


The status quo has got to go.  **How will you stand up to it?**

Most things are not seizures,"I'm finding that, more and more, ""seizure"" is becoming a catch-all term for literally any clinical phenomenon. Patients may be walking, talking, syncopal, actively having an MI, or all of the above - it's all considered seizure if it looks odd enough. In fact, just mentioning key words like ""shaking"" or ""seizure"" is often enough to prompt a neurology consult. Since seizures are a painfully heterogeneous phenomenon, this is not entirely unreasonable. But at the same time - and this should go without saying - most things are not seizures. Lately, some of the things that have raised concern for seizures have been a bit troubling. I feel like a bit of a jerk when I use terms like ""neurophobia,"" but... well, see below.    


A few weeks ago, I got a rather breathless call from one of the newer nurses in the ED, asking me to come help with a patient who simply would not stop seizing or fighting with staff (1). Not unkindly, I suggested that usually people are only able to do one of those things at a time. From what I could hear in the background, it sounded like a pitched battle at the moment, the sort of situation required Haldol + security, rather than Dilantin + me. But I knew this nurse; he's really nice, and he wouldn't have called unless he felt as if he had too. He also fell into that camp that believes that people generally operate by certain rules, and neurology is meant to explain all aberrations (2).     


Still, it was early in the week, when you're still filled with the sort of free-floating good will that pushed you towards medicine in the first place. So like a saint gearing up to sling alms, I holstered my tuning fork and trundled over to the ED, where I was greeted by the sight of a tall, skinny gargoyle of a man in a hospital gown. He was covered in old tattoos and scratches of varying age, with dried blood sheeting down the side of his head. I could see the tendons in his hands as he clutched the the doorway of his ED room and screamed at staff. Occasionally, he would point people out individually with one accusing finger, and you could see white in all 360 of the degrees around his pupils. Being off to the side just a little, I could also see the bright, quarter moon of his butt cheek as he informed the ED physician that ""I know you, motherfucker.(3)"" I sighed. A little crowd had gathered, maintaining a sensible 10ft radius, and they all watched these proceedings with the sort of ghastly expectation usually reserved for Japanese dating shows and Nascar races. I considered quietly moonwalking back the way I came - but then I saw why they had called me over.    


Mid-paragraph, he stopped. His teeth clenched and the cords of his neck stood out as he arched his head and neck back. He clenched his fists in front of him and looked very briefly like Bruce Lee warming up for a match. I had just realized that he was holding his breath when he squatted down to a half-crouch, his arms started to shake and his head rolled back - but he remained upright. I'm sure that, for the bystanders, it was very dramatic. To me, he looked like Bruce Banner forcing a BM and accidentally turning into the Hulk.   


The nurse that had called me started to ask for more ativan, and I told him to hold it for now. I'd read the chart beforehand: this man had already had enough benzos to fell a rhino in heat; his serum seemed to be 30% gin; his UDS was a Whitman-esque celebration of recreational substances. Overhearing me, the ED resident nodded wisely and started to call for Versed and Dilantin instead. I waved that off too, with a sort of growing desperation. Were we all seeing the same thing?    

Before somebody could talk themselves into administering a propofol drip with extreme prejudice, I walked over with my hands held up, as if to show that I was unarmed. I asked the patient, - still mid-squat, mind you - if he was doing alright, which was a ridiculous question. But he did look at my face mid-""seizure,"" which was more or less the point. I suggested we hang it up for a little bit and talk in his room, to which he snapped ""This ain't my room, shit head. My room is the streets. (4)""    


I glanced over his shoulder as if seeing the room for the first time. ""Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely the streets,"" I agreed. I've found that for these cases - cases with a high likelihood of ending in a scrum followed by 6 months of prophylactic anti-retrovirals - the best approach is to channel the serenity and bafflement of the cow as he crosses the intersection. So, we began to chat. He sat on the edge of (not) his bed while I asked stupid questions and checked stupid reflexes.    


I can't say that I remember our conversation verbatim, but I do remember certain exchanges.    


>Me: *(points to Saving Private Ryan-esque head wound)* ""What happened to your head there?""


>Him: ""How should I know?""


>Me: ""Well, do you remember what happened before, maybe? Did you fall? Were you in a fight? Did you wake up like that?""


>Him: ""Did you wake up like a *bitch*?""    

And...


>Me: ""Have you ever had seizures before?""


>Him: ""Everyone has seizures sometime, man.""


>Me: ""I don't know about that, but, um, have you ever been on seizure medications before?""


>Him: *(looking at me scathingly)* ""No. I don't wanna get addicted to that shit.""    

Also...

>Me: ""Is there anyone I can call? Maybe someone that was with you, might be able to say what happened?""


>Him: ""Goddamn sand n-gger, you tryin' to call Kevin? You tryin' to call **Kevin**?!""    


He kept repeating this last, louder and louder, as he stood up (5). For my own part, I backed out of the room, just as un-heroic as they come. And dear reader, I shit you not: as I back-pedaled, I heard another nurse warn everyone that ""Here comes another seizure!"" Why, if I hadn't been fleeing like a coward, I'd have had no words.    

The patient came out right after me, his hands tearing at his hospital gown. In a blink, he had it off and wadded up into a loose ball, which he fired past my head at the nursing station. He stood there, naked and heaving, covered in bizarre tattoos - lots of faded blue dice on his forearms, harlequin masks, sundry big boobed devils on motorcycles, etc. But, more specifically and terrifyingly, he had a tattoo of a wolf howling, drawn *en face* in faded blue ink with orange eyes - and it was tattooed on his crotch in such a way that his penis seemed to emerge from its mouth.    


This, I found, was my absolute limit. The bad consult I could handle. The swearing, insults and racism I could chalk up to hard living and neuro-chemical extremis. But the wolf? That had taken time and *forethought*. It was clearly the watermark of a personality that would take any AED's I started and return them to me rectally, before stealing my car keys. Security swarmed in, and I walked out.    


As I did, I passed the hospitalist he was being admitted to, and she asked me if I would be ordering an MRI, Keppra, any of that.    


I sighed again. ""No, He's got PNES, chronic crazy and essential racism. Let's start with a head CT and an EEG, if we can get them.""    


""But he's still seizing,"" she replied, looking at the anarchy over my shoulder. I looked back to see him hulking out again, as no less than three burly rent-a-cops tried to bulldoze him back into his room. Blessedly, the crowd of bodies kept me from finding out if he had an erection.    


""I don't think that's a seizure,"" I said, trying not to sound appalled.    


""Yes, he's seizing. I see it,"" she replied, and she actually pointed, as if that would clear things up for me. As if she hadn't been clear enough, or perhaps in case I'd gotten confused and examined the clothed, 82yo woman one room over.    


""Please don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think a seizure is what you think it is,"" I said, before shimmering out.    

----


1) I don't get called to the ED very much, and that's by design. We actually have a few separate neurology teams. If there's a patient that needs to be dipped in rTPA, the stroke team comes running. If somebody woke up with a couple of burst pipes, the neuro ICU is standing by with soft voices and warm hands. If somebody is having seizures, or anything resembling one, the ED orders a Hellfire strike of benzos with one hand, while putting in a non-urgent consult for ""prolonged post-ictal state"" with the other. Given all of these heroes - who are likely doing kettlebell swings or one-armed pullups while waiting for the Commissioner to blaze the signal - there's really only a sliver of niche emergencies that would require someone like me. This was not one of those cases.    

2) I tend to feel that the practice of neurology adheres to certain principles, while humanity - the species that yielded both Ska and Suge Knight - is a heaving mass of carbon and wild-eyed outliers, screaming into a void.    

3) He did, as it turned out. They'd met during his last visit to the ED, during which he'd threatened to beat up the little old lady in the room next to him before leaving AMA. So, you know, believe your patient.    

4) While he could have said it more nicely, he wasn't wrong. Besides, seizure aborted, right? I take my wins wherever and however I can.    

5) I am demonstrably non-white, but didn't seem to be what disturbed him most. If you can categorize things like this, I would say that he was being more collaterally than primarily racist. He seemed more focused on my possibly getting in touch with Kevin. I never found out much about Kevin, but it's hard to imagine that they shared a cubicle wall at the NAACP.

Edit: 

Thank you so much for the gold(s)! There have been some concerns, and so I'd like to clarify a few things: 

-I'm not trying to make fun of people with epilepsy, or those with PNES (or those with both). I'm simply trying to point out the tremendous amount of misunderstanding surrounding epileptic seizures. Hopefully while being funny. Obviously, your mileage may vary.

-I didn't simply stop treating this guy. I did try to figure out if he had epilepsy, which had led to him injuring himself. It was hard, because he was really difficult to deal with. I wasn't able to amass any evidence that he had epilepsy. 

-In particular, PNES is a very real and debilitating condition, and frankly, I didn't take it seriously enough for far too long during my residency. I regret that very much. People with PNES are not ""faking."" Distinguishing between these things is important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/eutt79/most_things_are_not_seizures/,2020-01-27 20:26:03,agra

"Police destroy a medic area during protests in Asheville, North Carolina.","After protests in Asheville, North Carolina, social media posts that show law enforcement busting water bottles went viral. The [incident Tuesday](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/06/03/asheville-protests-mostly-peaceful-ends-tear-gas-after-curfew-george-floyd/3130666001/) was caught on video and described by a medic volunteer. The protest marked the third day of demonstrations in Asheville in response to the death of a black man, George Floyd, in the custody of Minneapolis police officers.

[Video by the Citizen Times](https://www.citizen-times.com/videos/news/local/2020/06/03/asheville-police-destroy-water-bottles-medic-area/3133824001/) shows Asheville police officers in riot gear and holding shields forming a protective circle around officers stomping and stabbing water bottles. Other officers destroyed medical supplies such as bandages and saline solution.

Sean Miller, a UNC-Asheville student who is head of communication for the medical team, said the 10-12 medics present were all clearly marked as such and did not provoke police in any way. ""A few minutes after 8 o'clock, we saw a SWAT team coming at us,"" Miller said. ""They immediately, when they approached, they said, 'We're Asheville Police Department, and you guys need to leave.' They grabbed us by the shoulders and pushed out of the alleyway where we were trying to provide medical support."" She said they had a verbal agreement with APD to be present, even after curfew.

Some of the medics had bruises and felt the effects of tear gas, but no one was seriously injured. They lost at least $700 in supplies, Miller said. Officers didn't give them an explanation for the destruction, she said.

Glenna Grant, 33, [said she witnessed](https://twitter.com/daveth89/status/1267974555332685824) the officers destroy water bottles and medical supplies. Grant said she and others set up the medical center and did not plan to protest but rather provide a safe space for anyone injured during the night. Grant said officers ""hit them with shields” and took several people to the ground. “We had eye wash, sutures, EMTs and doctors,” Grant said. “They threw several people to the ground. We were thrown, shouted at, screamed at and treated like criminals. No one resisted.”

Jon Jones, who works with the medical team, said police struck down a peaceful operation, and ""those actions are inexcusable."" ""All of those officers took an oath to stand and protect the people, and there's no room for error in that,"" he said. 

In a [Facebook post Wednesday](https://www.facebook.com/esther.e.manheimer/posts/10222847776363880), Mayor Esther Manheimer acknowledged the incident, which occurred at 8:14 p.m. in a small alley off the main public square  downtown. ""I am aware of the incident involving officers destroying the medical supplies of demonstrators, including water bottles, food and other supplies,"" Manheimer wrote. ""Council has asked for an explanation of why that occurred. ""We are a city that cares, and I want to thank all of our officers who have taken a knee and worked to protect us,"" Manheimer continued. ""But this was a disappointing moment in an otherwise peaceful evening.""

Around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Police Chief David Zack issued a statement, explaining the officers were destroying potential projectiles at an unpermitted medical station. He said the medical crew received multiple warnings. ""We apologize for not being able to confiscate these supplies last night,"" Zack said in a news release. ""Over the past three days, APD has tried to eliminate objects that can be thrown at protesters and law enforcement. Because water bottles, in particular, have been continuously used over the last three nights, officers destroyed them. Officers also searched for potentially dangerous objects, such as explosives."" He said the medical station was on private property without permission of the owner.

 Miller disputes the chief's account, saying she was at the station starting at 4 p.m. June 2. ""We didn't receive a single warning,"" she said. ""They didn't warn us whatsoever."" She also said the mention of explosives was perplexing. ""There were absolutely no explosives within the medical area. None,"" Miller said. ""No fireworks, nothing that could even be perceived as dangerous."" Miller did acknowledge that they inadvertently set up on private property June 2 without the property owner's permission. They had spoken with management of the nearby restaurants and thought that was sufficient, she said, but they ""didn't have the awareness that there was a separate company that owned the entire property.""

"I posted a while back seeking a clinical portrait from those caring for COVID19 pts, and found a detailed one today from Evergreen. Please disseminate, esp to ICU/PACU/ED staff.","Got this being passed around my circle of physician co-workers... Somewhat interesting, although for most readers a lot of the medical jargon may be difficult to pick up:

This is from a front-line ICU physician in a Seattle hospital (*purported.  The exact source is being called into question.)

This is his personal account:

* we have 21 pts and 11 deaths since 2/28.

* we are seeing pts who are young (20s), fit, no comorbidities, critically ill. It does happen.

* US has been past containment since January

* Currently, all of ICU is for critically ill COVIDs, all of floor medsurg for stable COVIDs and EOL care, half of PCU, half of ER. New resp-sx pts Pulmonary Clinic offshoot is open

* CDC is no longer imposing home quarantine on providers who were wearing only droplet iso PPE when intubating, suctioning, bronching, and in one case doing bloody neurosurgery. Expect when it comes to your place you may initially have staff home-quarantined. Plan for this NOW. Consider wearing airborne iso PPE for aerosol-generating procedures in ANY pt in whom you suspect COVID, just to prevent the mass quarantines.

* we ran out of N95s (thanks, Costco hoarders) and are bleaching and re-using PAPRs, which is not the manufacturer's recommendation. Not surprised on N95s as we use mostly CAPRs anyway, but still.

*terminal cleans (inc UV light) for ER COVID rooms are taking forever, Enviro Services is overwhelmed. Bad as pts are stuck coughing in the waiting room. Rec planning now for Enviro upstaffing, or having a plan for sick pts to wait in their cars (that is not legal here, sadly).

* CLINICAL INFO based on our cases and info from CDC conf call today with other COVID providers in US:

* the Chinese data on 80% mildly ill, 14% hospital-ill, 6-8% critically ill are generally on the mark. Data very skewed by late and very limited testing, and the number of our elderly pts going to comfort care. - being young & healthy (zero medical problems) does not rule out becoming vented or dead - probably the time course to developing significant lower resp sx is about a week or longer (which also fits with timing of sick cases we started seeing here, after we all assumed it was endemic as of late Jan/early Feb). - based on our hospitalized cases (including the not formally diagnosed ones who are obviously COVID - it is quite clinically unique) about 1/3 have mild lower resp sx, need 1-5L NC. 1/3 are sicker, FM or NRB. 1/3 tubed with ARDS. Thus far, everyone is seeing: - nl WBC. Almost always lymphopenic, occasionally poly-predominant but with nl total WBC. Doesn't change, even 10days in. - BAL lymphocytic despite blood lymphopenic (try not to bronch these pts; this data is from pre-testing time when we had several idiopathic ARDS cases) - fevers, often high, may be intermittent; persistently febrile, often for >10d. It isn't the dexmed, it's the SARS2. - low ProCalc; may be useful to check initially for later trending if later concern for VAP etc. - up AST/ALT, sometimes alk phos. Usually in 70-100 range. No fulminant hepatitis. Notably, in our small sample, higher transaminitis at admit (150-200) correlates with clinical deterioration and progression to ARDS. LFTs typically begin to bump in 2nd week of clinical course. - mild AKI (Cr <2). Uncertain if direct viral effect, but notably SARS2 RNA fragments have been identified in liver, kidneys, heart, and blood.

* characteristic CXR always bilateral patchy or reticular infiltrates, sometimes perihilar despite nl EF and volume down at presentation. At time of presentation may be subtle, but always present, even in our pts on chronic high dose steroids. NO effusions. CT is as expected, rarely mild mediastinal LAD, occ small effusions late in course which might be related to volume status/cap leak.

* Note - China is CT'ing everyone, even outpts, as a primarily diagnostic modality. However, in US/Europe, CT is rare, since findings are nonspecific, would not change management, and the ENTIRE scanner and room have to terminal-cleaned, which is just impossible in a busy hospital. Also, transport in PAPRs. Etc. 2 of our pts had CTs for idiopathic ARDS in the pre-test era; they looked like the CTs in the journal articles. Not more helpful than CXR. - when resp failure occurs, it is RAPID (likely 7-10d out from sx onset, but rapid progression from hospital admit). Common scenario for our pts is, admit 1L NC. Next 12hrs -> NPPV. Next 12-24hrs -> vent/proned/Flolan. - interestingly, despite some needing Flolan, the hypoxia is not as refractory as with H1N1. Quite different, and quite unique. Odd enough that you'd notice and say hmmm. - thus far many are dying of cardiac arrest rather than inability to ventilate/oxygenate. - given the inevitable rapid progression to ETT once resp decompensation begins, we and other hosps, including Wuhan, are doing early intubation. Facemask is fine, but if needing HFNC or NPPV just tube them. They definitely will need a tube anyway, & no point risking the aerosols. - no MOSF. There's the mild AST/ALT elevation, maybe a small Cr bump, but no florid failure. except cardiomyopathy. - multiple pts here have had nl EF on formal Echo or POCUS at time of admit (or in a couple of cases EF 40ish, chronically). Also nl Tpn from ED. Then they get the horrible resp failure, sans sepsis or shock. Then they turn the corner, off Flolan, supined, vent weaning, looking good, never any pressor requirement. Then over 12hrs, newly cold, clamped, multiple-pressor shock that looks cardiogenic, EF 10% or less, then either VT->VF-> dead or PEA-> asystole in less than a day. Needless to say this is awful for families who had started to have hope. - We have actually had more asystole than VT, other facilities report more VT/VF, but same time course, a few days or a week after admit, around the time they're turning the corner. This occurs on med-surg pts too; one today who is elderly and chronically ill but baseline EF preserved, newly hypoTN overnight, EF<10. Already no escalation, has since passed, So presumably there is a viral CM aspect, which presents later in the course of dz. - of note, no WMAs on Echo, RV preserved, Tpns don't bump. Could be unrelated, but I've never seen anything like it before, esp in a pt who had been HD stable without sepsis.

Treatment -

*Remdesivir might work, some hosps have seen improvement with it quite rapidly, marked improvement in 1-3 days. ARDS trajectory is impressive with it, pts improve much more rapidly than expected in usual ARDS.

*Recommended course is 10d, but due to scarcity all hosps have stopped it when pt clinically out of the woods - none have continued >5d. It might cause LFT bump, but interestingly seem to bump (200s-ish) for a day or 2 after starting then rapidly back to normal - suggests not a primary toxic hepatitis.

*unfortunately, the Gilead compassionate use and trial programs require AST/ALT <5x normal, which is pretty much almost no actual COVID pts. Also CrCl>30, which is fine. CDC is working with Gilead to get LFT reqs changed now that we know this is a mild viral hepatitis.

-currently the Gilead trial is wrapping up, NIH trial still enrolling, some new trial soon to begin can't remember where.

*steroids are up in the air. In China usual clinical practice for all ARDS is high dose methylpred. Thus, ALL of their pts have had high dose methylpred. Some question whether this practice increases mortality.

*it is likely that it increases seconday VAP/HAP. China has had a high rate of drug resistant GNR HAP/VAP and fungal pna in these pts, with resulting increases mortality. We have seen none, even in the earlier pts who were vented for >10d before being bronched (prior to test availability, again it is not a great idea to bronch these pts now).

- unclear whether VAP-prevention strategies are also different, but wouldn't think so?

- Hong Kong is currently running an uncontrolled trial of HC 100IV Q8.

- general consensus here (in US among docs who have cared for COVID pts) is that steroids will do more harm than good, unless needed for other indications.

- many of our pts have COPD on ICS. Current consensus at Evergreen, after some observation & some clinical judgment, is to stop ICS if able, based on known data with other viral pneumonias and increased susceptibility to HAP. Thus far pts are tolerating that, no major issues with ventilating them that can't be managed with vent changes. We also have quite a few on AE-COPD/asthma doses of methylpred, so will be interesting to see how they do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/figd1n/i_posted_a_while_back_seeking_a_clinical_portrait/,2020-03-14 10:30:42,morbi
Rant: Don't belittle your colleagues.,"I witnessed two striking examples of unprofessionalism yesterday, and I'm ashamed of both of them.

In the first case I overheard a pair of GIM PGY2s loudly venting about the substandard care given to a patient by a hospitalist service. Have I vented like that? Absolutely. But they came to the conclusion that they would never want to be admitted to any service other than GIM in the hospital because nobody else is a real doctor and will kill you. And they were in a very public place surrounded by other doctors and patients.

In the second case my junior for the night, a PGY1 in neurosurgery, spent 20 minutes ranting to me about how useless and meaningless his 1 month rotation of general surgery is to him...in the middle of us doing an emergency total colectomy at 2 am. I was gently probing him to see if he could find any value in working with his colleagues, or if his patients ever experienced general surgery problems, and he just couldn't fathom why he'd been put through this torture. Nevermind the patient in extremis in front of him.

I get it, stress happens, burn out is real, I'm a chief resident in general surgery, I really do get it. 

Can we stop writing off and bashing entire other segments of medicine? Go punch a bag or take nap instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/e7m1z6/rant_dont_belittle_your_colleagues/,2019-12-07 23:53:25,tanda
More Physician Leadership in the US Healthcare System Would Save Lives. [Serious],"I realize that administration overstep creates frustration in almost every field, from education to anything corporate.  What bothers me most about administrative overstep in healthcare?  It doesn't appear to help patients get better care*, it doesn't rely on physicians,* it is one of the largest expenses in our system, and it is continuing to swell larger.^(1)  

Put generally, the US Healthcare system is failing to justify its costs.

Should wealthy shareholders be profiting to such an extent that we effectively drown the US Healthcare system, or do we ignore political differences and focus on unity through our shared humanity?  Here I will argue that physician de-emphasization has hurt the system, led to our current problems, and must be reversed.

How did this happen?  It’s complicated.  Over the past few decades, a collection of private lobbyists successfully leveraged more financial burdens onto patients and their physicians through corporate and government cost-containment strategies.  Physicians and the public were taken by surprise and did not successfully oppose increasing market-penetration schemes.  This incentivized more clinical scrutiny and administrative control.^(2-5)   Physicians became more inundated with paperwork, liability, and had reimbursements cut.  There was more pressure to make profits, which cut time with patients, and access to care became more restricted.

Ironically, the USA has -- for its expense -- relative underperformance in many metrics used to evaluate healthcare, including access to care, cost-effectiveness, suicide rates, life expectancy, and general pandemic response.^(6-9)   It would follow that reversing this power shift of the healthcare system, away from the wealthy and back into the hands of medical experts, would be the solution.

Physicians just need the public’s support.

A common viewpoint I’ve heard from overwhelmed physicians is that physician advocacy detracts from patient care.  Practically speaking, that is partially true.  However, as physicians, the effectiveness of our healthcare system is partially our responsibility.  As medical experts, our scientific viewpoint is needed to prevent the creation of policies that may hurt more lives than you could ever save in the hospital or clinic.

That is why US physicians must:

1. Admit we are losing our influence and need a change.
2. Resolve to promote a unified front against non-physician control of the US healthcare system.
3. Reverse engineer a long term solution through education on advocacy for medical students and physicians, along with input from the general public.

Great physicians are self-motivated leaders that live by shared humanity with our patients and their families.  Positively affecting the life of another person (in a way that few can) is our greatest reward.  We must become advocacy experts with the same ferocity as we have innovated new medical treatments, procedures, and technologies.

But how do you, a physician, speak out?  We must try to learn about professional advocacy, participate in politics, and talk about your issues with your colleagues.  Find unity.  If you haven’t read the classic book, Freakonomics, it discusses how to naturally incentivize others’ actions, and vice versa.^(9)  Physicians are being incentivized into silence, individualism, and tolerance of hardships for short-term job security, while living on hope that someone else will fix it.  But if our divisions worsen, the hardships will grow.

What hardships?  In the short term, further privatization by managed care firms and insurance companies will just continue to raise prices until fewer and fewer can afford care.^(11-12)  In the long term, non-physician control of the US healthcare system will continue to foster distrust in modern medicine, lessen the efficacy of modern therapies, and create larger costs fixing secondary comorbidities arising from lack of preventative care and logical policymaking.

As a society, we must admit that physicians are being covertly bullied, silenced, and deemphasized to increase healthcare profits for non-physician shareholders and administrators.  Is that what we want?  As patients, we must speak out.  Most recently, hospital shareholders and administrators created physician pay cuts during COVID19 associated declines in patient volume.^(13-15)  Ironically, they are targeted in the name of curbing health care costs, yet administrators in the US healthcare system consume many more health care dollars than physicians.^(16)

Now we all have a decision to make.  Physicians need the public’s support, but we need each other's enthusiasm more.  I encourage you all to educate yourselves on effective advocacy strategies, think outside the box, and look for ways to come together.  Physicians are bound by our Hippocratic oath to speak out against US Healthcare policies that prioritize profits over patients:

\*I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.^(17)

Patients should stand with their physicians and support changes to favor science over money.  Physicians, when you’re feeling discouraged, remember that your patients have placed their lives in your hands.  Your job is not an easy one.  It's not one that most people can do.  Your voice counts.  Your actions matter.  What will you do?

# We’re in this together.

**TL;DR:**  US Healthcare is not justifying its expense.  Cost-cutting measures and profiteering policies created by non-physician administrators are worsening this.  Physicians regain must speak out to regain control of the healthcare system.  The public must be educated and support the movement.

Anonymous writings of a covid nurse - part 2,"*One…two…three…four…five…six…seven….*

It takes me exactly three hundred and eighty-seven steps to walk the entire loop of my unit and arrive back where I started. I should know…I’ve counted it hundreds of times by now.

Back in the days before when I could find the time, I would toss my Vocera at any willing coworker and meander around campus for fifteen minutes or so to get a break from the demands of being a bedside nurse. I’d wander outside to the employee patio and get a glimpse of the sky, sit next to the fountain, enjoy the sun a bit. Maybe pick my way through the gift shop and buy some trinket to bring home to my daughter. Sometimes I’d go visit my friends that had transferred to other floors. Such social calls were normal back then. It wasn’t always possible of course, but before all of this it was possible to find the time more often than it wasn’t.

It started with a single patient at first. Then it was two. Six. Fourteen. They’ll only be placed in negative pressure rooms, it was announced. That lasted for approximately five days. Then any positive case requiring less than six LPM were allowed in standard rooms. Thirty-five. We can handle it, our CEO proclaimed. There were plans in place. Fifty-three. Elective procedures were cancelled. PPE was short, you’ll need to reuse your N95. Place it in this brown paper bag and keep it on your iso carts. Nono, it’s perfectly safe, probably. Seventy-nine. Units were locked. Patient loads were getting top-heavy and cumbersome to manage. Incentive pay was announced. Then increased. Then increased again. One hundred and four. “Heroes work here” signs. Codes overhead every hour, the sickening feeling of ribs breaking under your hands. Exhaustion. Difficulty sleeping. Two hundred and twenty-two. So many stroke alerts. The sound of families sobbing over Zoom as their loved ones gasped their last breaths. Two hundred and fifty-four. Will this fucking pager ever *stop beeping.* Single rooms are now doubles, a Black Friday two for one. Two hundred and ninety-nine. Coworkers are getting sick at an alarming rate. Anna’s on the vent in MICU waitlisted to be transferred to a different facility for ECMO because we’re at capacity. Chris was just admitted, he’s on IMCU riding the vapotherm and looking like shit. Three hundred and thirty-one. Blistered feet. Nine days in a row and three more on the schedule. Crash intubation after crash intubation. The claustrophobic feeling of drowning in patients, tasks, and dexamethasone. Three hundred and eighty-eight. Bleeding cuticles, grinding teeth without noticing until your jaw aches. How can this continue? How can this…how….

…

And just when I thought this whole godforsaken house was about to collapse, it began to ease.

I took to pacing my locked unit like a caged tiger after the last wave crested, turning corner after corner within the same four walls. There was still no time for campus walks anymore, and we were forbidden that sort of freedom of movement anyway. But by then it felt like a cardinal sin to sit down and do nothing. Returning to some semblance of normal didn’t quite feel normal to me yet. Instead, my usual fifteen minute cool-down period had turned into a way to expend bottled anxiety and energy.

“Getting your steps in, Taylor?” my coworkers would ask.

I’d fake a smile, nod, and keep going.

Two hundred and five. I cut down to a normal amount of overtime. One hundred and seventy-one. My arm hurt like a motherfucker after that vaccine. Ninety-eight. Electives resumed. Sixty. Floors were converted back to their original service designations. Fourty-four. My dad, full of optimism and synthetic mRNA, visited for the first time in eleven months. We drank a beer on the patio and laughed at the absurdity of the cardboard cutout fans in the stands of the game we were watching. Twenty-seven.

It’s oddly quiet around here now. The amount of emails I receive from administration have dropped off precipitously. During the surge, I would count the number of red-orange covid isolation signs taped to the doors on my daily prowls. At one point they adorned every single room.

Today, I count three.

It feels as if the dust has settled a bit. The place looks normal but has the same palpable tension as an empty street, littered with the broken glass and spent tear-gas cannisters that inevitably follow a riot. We may have swept the debris into the gutters, but the memory of the event hangs in the air like the lingering scent of sulphur. The faces of my colleagues are no longer so worn. We’re all dealing with what we’ve seen in different ways. Some are dealing better than others. Some aren’t dealing with it at all. A stoic few deny there’s anything to deal with in the first place. This is what we do, they scoff. This is what we’re here for.

I don’t know where I fall on this spectrum.

“Try not to focus on all the lost causes,” my favorite tech instructs me after we rambled a bit on the topic at lunch. “I mean…have you thought about all the ones we saved?”

I pause. It’s so easy to focus on the negative that I’m ashamed to admit I haven’t.

“What about that one guy that was in bed 3 forever?” she continues. “You discharged him on New Year’s Day. He’d been on a vent for like two weeks. That was pretty amazing.”

It was, I agree.

“And remember Mrs. Graham, or Garman, or…whatever her name was. She was here for over 90 days and walked out under her own power without oxygen.”

I must have taken care of her at least a dozen times or better and I’d completely forgotten about her. Unbelievable.

I spend the remainder of my two scheduled shifts catching my coworkers during lulls and asking them about their saves, too. Ashley tells me about Mr. Sacks who she discharged to LTACH. He’s walking now, she quips. Casey reminds me of another patient who was able to have their trach and PEG discontinued before leaving. That guy that had the stroke while SAPed? We thought he’d leave in a body bag but he’s back to work. And we all remember our most memorable case, a failed compassionate extubation that sent a freakin’ Christmas card to the staff after breezing through rehab.

The stories start piling up. Five. Twelve. Twenty-eight. I stop counting and catch myself smiling, feeling lighter than I have in a year.

It’s unrealistic to think that any of us will ever be exactly the same as we were before living through these times. God knows I won’t. But at least now, I can view these memories like a coin. One side contains all of the anger, the hurt, and the sheer misery that we were forced to stomach as we performed our duties. But the other? It holds the precious victories, the joy we saw on our patient’s faces as they left our facility. The times we went toe to toe with death and won.

I’m back at work tomorrow morning. Maybe I’ll skip down to the fountain, take my mask off, and sit for a bit. It's past time to see if things still looks the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/mnql47/anonymous_writings_of_a_covid_nurse_part_2/,2021-04-09 21:01:10,tanda
I'm sick of the fringe medicine,"Believe me, I am all for the practice of medicine. Sometimes you have to get a bit creative in treatment plans. Patients who for some reason don't want to take a blood pressure pill and have terrible anxiety, fine we will settle on long acting propranolol because that is the only thing they agree to take.

Screw these doctors who are pushing bullshit though.


In the past 6 months I've been getting more and more out there treatments though showing up at my door.

Turns out there is a doctor now nearby who is into ""biohacking"" functional medicine and doing twice yearly DEXA scans and 10 pages of labs. Website links to his book and his store where you can even buy salmon that he certifies, a HEPA filter for covid, and a fucking 5g faraday cage https://imgur.com/a/gczd5cj (edit the link since the previous crop was bad and had the doctors name on the supplements.)

Two of this doctors patients this week have landed in my clinic requesting testosterone therapy and DEXA order + 90 pills of Viagra and Adderall.

I request previous labs and review them this morning. Initial testosterone levels were in the 400s in one patient and 500s in another prior to starting on testosterone it seems.

These patients yelled at my staff and got all upset that I would not refill their meds.

Shame on anyone who falls into this money making BS.

The Penis-Eating Kobold Vacuum Cleaner - a Partial Translation of the Most Absurd Case Series in Medical History,"**The Penis-Eating Kobold Vacuum Cleaner - a Partial Translation of the Most Absurd Case Series in Medical History**

**Introduction**: The penis-eating Kobold vacuum cleaner is a marvelous story, legend and meme among medical students and physicians in the German-speaking world. And not only among them, through public readings by renown authors and actors and an own audiobook, this case series made its way into a broader German audience. Talking with non-Germans, I realized this great piece of medical history has not been previously translated into English.

**Objective**: To entertain medical professionals outside of the German-speaking world.

**Results**: Ongoing.

**Conclusion**: Kobold vacuum cleaner goes brrrr.

**Full text**

""[Penis Injuries during Masturbation with Vacuum Cleaners](http://brennessel.blogsport.de/images/DOKTORARBEIT_Penisverletzungen_bei_Masturbation_mit_Staubsaugern.pdf)"" is the full title of this Dr. med. thesis from the Faculty of Medicine of the Technical University of Munich from 1978. It is obviously graphic and not safe for work unless you are an urologist, I guess.

*Skip this part if you are not interested in academical bureaucracy*: To summarize this ""*byzantine scheme*"" (a quote from a redditor on this sub) briefly: German physicians graduate from medical school with no Dr. title by default, they are just ""Herr Max Mustermann, Arzt"" or ""Frau Erika Mustermann, Ärztin"", basically ""Mr. John Doe, physician."" To be able to call yourself Dr. med. NAME, you need to **finish and defend a Dr. med. thesis**. These have a huge variety from meaningful experimental or clinical projects, often with a strong publication as first author, up to retrospective chart-review projects which would sometimes barely pass as a master thesis in other sciences. Within German law, the Dr. med. is theoretically on par with the Dr. phil or Dr. rer. nat. (most common types of PhD) but since the quality is so often below the standards of a PhD, the EU does not recognize it as a PhD for e.g. grant eligibility. The proportion of medical students and graduates finishing Dr. med. projects is at 55-70% and declining since the job market got much, much better since the 90s. No offense to the author of the thesis, but it would likely be not accepted in this form nowadays.

Anyways, in this Dr. med. thesis, Michael Alschibaja Theimuras, at this time an urology resident at the *Clinic on the Right Bank of the Isar,* the university hospital of TU Munich reviewed 16 cases of Penis injuries caused by men masturbating with a particular type of a German vacuum cleaner, the ""Kobold"" of the company Vorwerk & CO., Elektro KG., Wuppertal. This type was found in 8 cases while the information was missing in the 8 other ones. The insidious thing about this vacuum cleaner until it had to be changed after these findings: After just 11 cm, anything inserted makes contact with a rotating propeller. Dr. Theimuras is still a practicing urologist in his private practice in Munich, his son by the same name is his partner.

While penis injuries are not particularly funny on their own, the mode of injury and the stories the patients provided as explanations are what makes this thesis a gem. We all know ""I fell on it."" This is even better. I will concentrate on the best, especially cases 14 and 15 which are gold in combination.

>Case 9 Be., 60 years old, Roman Catholic \[*this is the 70s, of course this is relevant!*\], divorced, occupation: haulage contractor  
>  
>Case history  
>  
>The patient allegedly injured his penis while repairing a coffee grinder. However, everything clearly pointed to vacuum cleaner injury.

&#x200B;

>Case 10, Fe., 59 years old, Roman Catholic, divorced, occupation: mechanic  
>  
>Mode of injury  
>  
>His girlfriend had been cleaning the apartment on the day of the accident. He was lying on the bed. She wanted to tease him and put the vacuum cleaner over his abdomen. He had felt an exciting tickling sensation in his penis. To intensify this, she would take off the brush attachment of the vacuum cleaner (brand ""Kobold""). When his girlfriend then touched his non-erect penis with the vacuum cleaner suction tube, the penis was sucked into the vacuum cleaner. He felt a terrible pain. Because he was embarrassed, he first tried to treat his penis wounds himself. But when after 10 hours the bleeding had not stopped, he went to a physician.

&#x200B;

>Case 11, Be., 70 years old, no religion, divorced, occupation: pensioner  
>  
>Case history:  
>  
>The patient stated that he had fallen from a table onto a garden chair and had sustained a penile injury during this. Such a depiction is very unlikely. The nature of the injury is typical of a vacuum cleaner injury.

&#x200B;

>Case 13, Ju., 46 years old, Roman Catholic, married, occupation: insurance clerk  
>  
>Case history:  
>  
>The patient stated that he had been cleaning his car with a vacuum cleaner. Since the vacuum cleaner did not belong to him, he was not familiar with the device and accidentally hit the switch. He had just taken off his pants but had not yet put on his swimming trunks. At the moment when the vacuum cleaner went on, his penis was in the immediate vicinity of the suction tube. He felt a strong suction on the penis and then everything was drowning in blood.

&#x200B;

>Case 14, Zi., 31 years old, married, occupation: welder  
>  
>Case history  
>  
>The 31-year-old patient had been married for 2 years. According to his own statement, he had been raised very strictly. Sexual problems were never discussed in his parental home. He had also never been taught sexual education. He had masturbated for the first time at the age of 14. Until his marriage, he had masturbated about twice a week. His wife had a strict Catholic upbringing. He describes living a harmonious marriage. However, his wife was sexually very reserved.  
>  
>Mode of injury  
>  
>The patient's wife was travelling for 2 weeks and was about to return on the next day. While cleaning the apartment, he had been leafing through magazines and had been aroused by this. In his mind, he thought about fellatio and associated it with ""sucking"" and ""vacuum cleaner"" \[*saugen -> Staubsauger in German, makes more sense*\]. Afterwards, he inserted his half-erect penis with the foreskin retracted into the suction tube of a running ""Kobold"" vacuum cleaner. Simultaneously, there was a terrible bang and he bled strongly from the penis. The pain set in only gradually.

&#x200B;

>Case 15, Zi., 59 years old, Lutheran, married, occupation: craftman  
>  
>Case history  
>  
>The **father of the patient presented in case 14** confronted his son on the day he was discharged from the hospital after the known penis injury. He did not believe that he had inflicted his penile injury with a vacuum cleaner. He accused him of having cheated on his wife who was out of town at the time. He attributed the penis injury to a bite wound. The next day he decided to see if such an injury was possible with a vacuum cleaner. For this purpose, he inserted his penis into a running ""Kobold"" vacuum cleaner. In fractions of a second, the vacuum cleaner was pulled towards his body. He felt a sharp pain, so he pushed the vacuum cleaner away. His penis had become very small and almost disappeared in his abdomen. He immediately went to the nearest hospital.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/lofh24/the_peniseating_kobold_vacuum_cleaner_a_partial/,2021-02-20 20:07:33,tanda
Stanford faculty disavow former colleague Scott Atlas - Trump's current favorite physician adviser on COVID,"[EDIT: Apologies for keeping the mods busy!]

This letter was sent out to all Stanford School of Medicine faculty yesterday. The signatories include virtually every notable member of the ID, micro/immunology, and epidemiology/pop health departments, including the former Dean. They aren't mincing words. https://imgur.com/gallery/EJZxe7B

September 9, 2020

Dear Colleagues,

As infectious diseases physicians and researchers, microbiologist and immunologists,
epidemiologists and health policy leaders, we stand united in efforts to develop and promote
science-based solutions that advance human health and prevent suffering from the coronavirus
pandemic. In this pursuit, we share a commitment to a basic principle derived from the
Hippocratic Oath: Primum Non Nocere (First, Do No Harm).

To prevent harm to the public’s health, we also have both a moral and an ethical responsibility to
call attention to the falsehoods and misrepresentations of science recently fostered by Dr. Scott
Atlas, a former Stanford Medical School colleague and current senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute at Stanford University. Many of his opinions and statements run counter to established
science and, by doing so, undermine public-health authorities and the credible science that
guides effective public health policy. The preponderance of data, accrued from around the
world, currently supports each of the following statements:

● The use of face masks, social distancing, handwashing and hygiene have been shown to
substantially reduce the spread of Covid-19. Crowded indoor spaces are settings that
significantly increase the risk of community spread of SARS-CoV-2.

● Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 frequently occurs from asymptomatic people, including
children and young adults, to family members and others. Therefore, testing
asymptomatic individuals, especially those with probable Covid-19 exposure is important
to break the chain of ongoing transmission.

● Children of all ages can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. While infection is less common
in children than in adults, serious short-term and long-term consequences of Covid-19 are
increasingly described in children and young people.

● The pandemic will be controlled when a large proportion of a population has developed
immunity (referred to as herd immunity) and that the safest path to herd immunity is
through deployment of rigorously evaluated, effective vaccines that have been approved
by regulatory agencies.

● In contrast, encouraging herd immunity through unchecked community transmission is
not a safe public health strategy. In fact, this approach would do the opposite, causing a
significant increase in preventable cases, suffering and deaths, especially among
vulnerable populations, such as older individuals and essential workers.

Commitment to science-based decision-making is a fundamental obligation of public
health policy. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the US, with consequent morbidity
and mortality, are among the highest in the world. The policy response to this pandemic
must reinforce the science, including that evidence-based prevention and the safe
development, testing and delivery of efficacious therapies and preventive measures,
including vaccines, represent the safest path forward. Failure to follow the science -- or
deliberately misrepresenting the science – will lead to immense avoidable harm.
We believe that social and economic activity can reopen safely, if we follow policies that
are consistent with science. In fact, the countries that have reopened businesses and
schools safely are those that have implemented the science-based strategies outlined
above.

Why the Appropriation of the Terms Residency and Fellowship is Wrong,"Residency training has been part of physician education after medical school for about [125 years](https://www.ama-assn.org/education/improve-gme/history-residency-and-what-lies-ahead).  Initially, though, residency wasn’t a requirement following medical school. Today, physicians must complete at least one year of residency to obtain a license to practice medicine–in some states, even that [isn’t enough](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2019/09/california-to-require-three-years-of-gme-for-full-physician-licensure/).

To become board-certified, physicians must complete 3 to 7 years of residency, depending on their chosen specialty. **Physicians in their first year of residency are often known as interns.**

Fellowships are physician education beyond residency.  A fellowship is meant to provide more specialized training within a specific field of medicine. For instance, after finishing a residency in Internal Medicine (3 years after medical school), a physician might choose to then specialize in cardiology by doing a Cardiology Fellowship (another 3 years).

Physician residencies and fellowships are accredited by the [Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME),](https://www.acgme.org/What-We-Do/Overview)which ensures that uniform standards are met for all programs. These standards include educational guidelines, milestones, and assessments, along with graduated patient care responsibility. The ACGME annually reviews all programs to ensure compliance with the standards, and they regularly update their standards to ensure excellent trainee education.

*Residencies and fellowships are rigorous undertakings. Traditionally, these trainees are referred to as “housestaff” or “house officers,” terms which* [*originated* ](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/house-officer)*from the time when trainees literally lived in “house” at the hospital.*

## Appropriations of the Terms “Residency” and “Fellowship”

It has recently been brought to light that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) have developed programs that institutions are calling “residencies” and “fellowships.” While this was spurred on by recent news of a possible NP/PA Emergency Medicine “Residency” at the University of North Carolina (UNC), UNC is hardly alone in this. To their credit, once they learned of the opposition to the use of the term residency, they have agreed that any future program that is developed will not utilize that term.

However, many programs still exist at other institutions, including, but not limited to, the [Johns Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/education_training/nurse_practitioner_fellowship_program.html), the [Mayo Clinic](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/health-sciences-education/nurse-practitioner-or-physician-assistant-emergency-medicine-fellowship-minnesota/), [Massachusetts General (Harvard)](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/pcgm/palliative-care/education/np-fellowship), [Penn State](https://residency.med.psu.edu/programs/apc-dermatology-fellowship/), and [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vumc.org/nursingoap/50658). With few exceptions, these programs are just 12 months in length, often with multiple “administrative half days.” Further, these programs are not necessarily standardized or accredited. In many of these fellowships, the NP or PA is paid more than a first-year physician resident who has completed far more training while in medical school.

Lastly, and perhaps most disheartening, many of these programs claim equivalence with physician training, although they are 1/3 or less of the residency training time for physicians. Some of the programs claim “[comparable training experiences](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/education_training/nurse_practitioner_fellowship_program.html)” to physicians with “[residents functioning as house-staff members.](https://www.montefiore.org/critical-care-professional-training-programs-residency)” By simple definition, PAs and NPs, while valued members of the team, cannot function at the same level as a physician resident or fellow. They simply do not have the same rigorous basic science and clinical education that physicians receive during medical school.

Even beyond NP and PA training using the terms “residency” and “fellowship” are the nursing (RN) programs doing the same.  Some hospitals have [renamed their RN orientation process, calling it “residency”](https://www.nursingcas.org/inside-the-nurse-residency-experience/).  Using these words, which have long been part of physician training lexicon, for new nurse orientation and onboarding, devalues them and can confuse patients.

## Why This is Wrong

When patients are admitted to the hospital, they often see interns, residents and fellows as part of their treatment team. Physicians introduce themselves and their role on the team. When PAs and NPs introduce themselves as a resident or fellow, it is very confusing to patients. Patients do not understand that they are not seeing a physician. In fact, even without this confusing terminology, patients are confused about who is taking care of them. The AMA did a survey that found that [35% of the general public](https://www.entnet.org/sites/default/files/TIA.6-30-2014.AMA%20Survey.pdf) believed that NPs with their doctorate of nursing practice were physicians.

Completing a residency or fellowship is a significant milestone in physician education, and it’s something physicians aspire to and celebrate.  When other fields appropriate physician-specific terminology for a portion of their training, it is demoralizing.

*Physicians consider their time in residency and fellowship as an initiation into the profession. It is a time of great emotional, personal, and financial sacrifice, all in the name of honing skills to become the best physician possible for their patients.*

When these terms are misused, it cheapens the physician experience. **Physician burnout and suicide are at an all time high and, to put it frankly, we cannot stand more blows.**

## Taking a Stand

At least two professional organizations, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) have taken a stand against this. In the AAD [position statement](https://server.aad.org/Forms/Policies/Uploads/PS/PS-Dermatology%20Residency%20and%20Fellowship%20Training.pdf), they state that the “education of physicians and non-physician clinicians is entirely different…this labeling \[of advanced practice residencies or fellowships\] is **misleading to the general public as it portrays a level of training that has not been established**.”

The AAEM [position statement](https://www.aaem.org/resources/statements/position/em-training-programs-for--pas-and-nps) takes it a step further and recommends that NP/PA education programs should only be used to “prepare its participants to practice only as members of a physician-led team” and “should be initiated with the consultation of residents and faculty.” We hope that other organizations and institutions take a stance and re-name these programs. One example is Brown University’s “[Physician Extender Development Program.](https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/about/departments/emergency-medicine/emped)”

## A Call for Change

When you are in the hospital or at a clinic, you may be taken care of by interns, residents, fellows, attendings, and non-physician clinicians. Traditionally, interns, residents, fellows and attendings are all physicians who have completed medical school. Non-physician clinicians include physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs).

**PAs and NPs are now calling their additional training “fellowships” or “residencies” and may refer to themselves as a resident or fellow. However, they are not physicians and their programs are not rigorously standardized or accredited. We hope these programs will change their terminology and find their own language for NP and PA training.**

2. The vaccines are still ""experimental"" - They are not, over 3.8 BILLION doses have been given.

4. The pᴉʌoɔ vaccine has a microchip in it - it doesn't, the microchip is in your phone and the facebook app you are using
5. I can't get it ""insert some medical reason"" - This is obviously a discussion you should have with your doctor, however- if you are truly one of the less than 1% of people who it is recommended against you should be encouraging everyone else to get the vaccine as you are very high risk to die from pᴉʌoɔ.
6.  buy and hodl doge
7.  I am pregnant, I can’t get it – yes you can and should, pregnant women are high risk to end up in the ICU/die from pᴉʌoɔ.  
8.  Masks don’t help protect from respiratory illness – lol
9.  FDA hasn’t approved it yet – Yes, they have.  They just have a mechanism to approve things quicker called an EUA.  The only reason it is still under the EUA is because of their antiquated waiting period. 
10.  I am young and healthy so pᴉʌoɔ won’t affect me – See our current ICU census
11.  We have other effective treatments such as ivermectin, HCQ, etc – No we don’t. None of them have shown any benefit in pᴉʌoɔ.  We have a vaccine and oxygen and a breathing tube. 
12. The government can’t mandate things, this is America – see seatbelts

My experience as a front-line doctor in a 3rd World Country,"
**My experience as a front-line doctor in a 3rd World Country:**


After finishing med school, doctors in India do a year of internship in a hospital. The US MD system gives me a splitting headache, so I'll compare it to the Foundation Year 1 of UK MBBS doctors as a 1:1 equivalent.


At this stage, you are nominally a qualified doctor, with a provisional certificate, and are allowed to practise under the eye of a senior.

Of course, the degree of autonomy is high, as our seniors are overworked and understaffed, so we're mostly left to our own devices unless something very unfamiliar shows up. In some cases, the interns outright run the show, with the Post Grads showing up once or twice a week, not that we had to go through that ourselves. 


I personally went from the freezer to the fire, with no frying pan in between, going from a rather provincial, rural and low occupancy hospital to one that's just about the busiest in the whole country. Let's recap my experience here so far-


India has a mixed healthcare system, as by law, all citizens are entitled to free medical care at any government hospital. Given the relative poverty of the country, they do roaring business, while the middle class and above prefer to visit private clinics and hospitals due to lower congestion and less headache in general.

Think of it like the NHS, but poor in everything except potential patients haha.

Now, Government hospitals get a *bad rep* in this country. There's a good reason why most people who can afford it prefer private care. They're insanely crowded, with doctor:patient ratios that are rounding errors, and many of them have near permanent camps on premises where the family of the patients stay due to an inability to afford better. 

Noisy, dirty, overcrowded. All of these are true.


But somehow, the fucking things *work*.

Before I started work here, I had no personal experience with them, having studied at  and visited private clinics all my life. I was expecting the absolute worst, and gritting my teeth hoping to make it through the year.


Let's just say that my arrival at the **Medicine Ward** did little to disillusion me.

Every available bed had a patient crammed onto it, and trying to cross the ward was an exercise in hop scotch, or crossing a minefield. It was 50:50 whether you'd step on one of patients who had been shunted to the floor, or a pile of poop.

Thankfully (?) it turned out to be *cat* poop.


You'd think you'd visited the lair of a combined hoarder/crazy cat lady, there about 2 of them for every patient, they walked around like they owned the place, ate the leftovers, and lubricated the floors.

On my first day, I heard two senior doctors remarking on a remarkably mishappen kitten, with bulbous eyeballs, and how the rest of the litter was turning off.

It quickly dawned on me that you couldn't expect any better from cats raised on a diet of human blood and teratogenic drugs from the disposal bins where 'proper waste disposal' was more of a suggestion than a firm guideline.


Now, if you think the doctors were living a life of luxury while their patients cosplayed for Oliver Twist, you couldn't be further from the mark.

Our single room for the oncalls was barely cleaner than the wards, and only had the minor benefit of air-conditioning.

In exchange for cats, it had an abundance of cockroaches, aping a rather crappy Tom and Jerry knockoff called Oggie and the Cockroaches, because Cat and Rat is *passe*, but Cat and Cockroach isn't.

For the first 2 weeks with 24 hour duties, I didn't sleep a moment, for fear of being overrun. Sleep did win over in the end, but I spent quite a bit of time fruitlessly spraying insecticides to no discernable effect. The immigration from the ward was far too strong.


You'd go on rounds, and have a roughly 25% chance of finding a dead patient, who had passed away quietly and unremarkably in the humid night, exhaling away with their last breath the blessing of silence to their neighbors, who tossed, turned and moaned in the heat.

Some claim that cats can tell when someone is about to die, and love climbing onto them. Apparently it's something to do with the higher temperatures of the moribund and fevered, but our resident felines didn't give a shit. Only the flies stayed behind, I hope when they sat on sightless eyes and rubbed their hands gleefully, it counted as a prayer to some twisted god, because nobody else would bother.. 

I convinced myself the deaths didn't hurt me, until about a month in, when I found one of our John Does dead on the floor, and then, half an hour later, just as I was about to reach a patient in order to check his pressure and pulse before our rounds, I was met by grievous wails. His daughter was sobbing next to her, begging me *""Why?""* as I dropped to the floor, and confirmed that he was indeed dead.

I knew it wasn't my fault, the man had enough comorbidities to be a medical curiosity, but when I went back to the room, I found my eyes burning with angry tears, and a sob from my chest as I realized my impotence in the vast scheme of things.

There was nobody to console me, and I haven't cried since.


I left the ward bitter. And definitely with toxoplasmosis.


But happily enough, this is where the horror stories end.

In the rest of my rotations, in Surgery, Gynecology, and Orthopedics, I was impressed by the general cleanliness and efficiency of the place.

99% of our patients received timely, adequate care, pretty much all the drugs on the WHO's essential medications list was available, and we never lacked for access to all the other medical paraphernalia such as IV cannulas, urobags etc.

Surgeries were done swiftly, competently and with **strict** asepsis, especially orthopedics, where we were scared to breathe for fear of being yelled at for contaminating something haha.


Some of the benefits to practicing here were-

1) Defensive medicine hasn't become ubiquitous here. Sure, we're on the hook, but the sheer litigiousness that plagues the US hasn't made it to this subcontinent. Barring gross incompetence, patients here mostly grin and bear it.

2) Oh Jesus I've seen enough patients here for two lifetimes, whatever deficiencies existed in my clinical knowledge were treated as firmly as dropping a baby with scurvy into a swimming pool filled with lemons.


3)Dealing with insurance was a non-issue, everyone was treated for free, I take it this is a serious pain for US doctors? 

4) Very competent teachers. You sort of have to be, to even keep your head above water.

The cons, however-

1) You've never experienced the true extent and horror of crippling poverty until you've been at a government hospital. For many, **free** Healthcare is a cost too high to bear, as affording transport from whatever rural village they came from stretched their resources to breaking point. I've seen so many tense up when I tell them that they need a medication that isn't freely available, and try to beg and bargain for a free replacement. Sadly, there often isn't any..

2) Insanely rude and disrespectful behavior towards patients and their companions is everywhere. Minor errors will get them yelled at, half the time nobody is willing to clear any confusions they might have. They might simply be unable to navigate instructions written in English.

3) I've seen women get *slapped* by female doctors  in gynecology, if they were being uncooperative in the midst of labor. If physical assault doesn't faze you, some of them were even told and threatened with the death of their babies in-utero if they didn't shut up and stop screaming from the pain of something as soporific as child birth. 

To an extent, I understand this, even if I don't condone it. When you have 5 minutes at most per patient, a line several hundred long, and you're forced to deal with severe stupidity, it's *very very easy* to just **snap**. Thankfully, I never felt the urge to lay hands on patients myself, let alone give into it.. 

4)Due to insufficient non-medical staff, the family and friends of patients are expected to handle all the gruntwork of getting X-rays done, arranging for blood bags to be brought etc. If you don't have someone around to handle this, you're really, really fucked. You might be able to hire someone to do it, but given our demographics.. They simply went untreated or treated very late when someone was cajoled into doing it. 

5) GPs get no respect here. Not having an MD after your MBBS is seen as a sign of serious deficiency, and fuels a self-fulfilling cycle.

6) On the topic of MDs: Our government has an extremely paternalistic attitude towards doctors, and on completion of your 3 years of MD training, you're obliged to go for 2 years of 'Bond Posting', which, while it gives you a License to Kill Germs, is not nearly as cool as it sounds. You *will* get sent to some rural backwater village, and in India, unlike the US, backwater doesn't mean that they have DSL internet, but dirt poor villages where electricity is far from given, where you'll might even  be operating under the leaves of a banyan tree, which in all likelihood is a cooler and more sanitary place than the mouldy Primary Healthcare Centre that is nominally the nexus of care for about 50k people. You get underpaid, overworked, and everything can fall on your shoulders if you're the only doctor around. The 'bond' here comes from the rule that you need to pay a fine of around INR 3, 000,000,in order to leave early, which is about $40,000. Given PPP, that is an enormous sum, and enough to dissuade most people from leaving. What ends up happening quite often is that Doctors hire other, incompetent or actually *unlicensed* 'doctors' to work in their staid, paying them portions of their own salary so that they can fuck off and actually work in humane conditions. That's a good outcome in fact, because what happens in certain states is that the money gets paid as a bribe to government officials, so that the doctor is marked as physically present, while the actual PHC consists of a goat on a chain and a register book. The book and the chain are government property, and the goat only lives there part time. 

Needless to say, I despise this high handedness on the part of the Government, as instead of paying a market wage or doing any actual infrastructure development, they force us to do 'social service' on grounds of alleviating the pressure of medical care in the the hinterlands. No other profession, such as lawyers or engineers, are conscripted in such a manner either. Anyway, to the GOI, 'supply and demand' is a Western Concept, and hence intrinsically suspicious. Why do anything so crude when you can club people over the head and make them work for you in severely demotivating conditions, so they can rubber stamp treatment and pack people off to the big city? 

7) **I DON'T GET PAID**. Not a cent. This is because I chose to leave my old hospital and switch to the big city, a move that deprived me to my right of a salary. So not only am I overworked, I'm not even paid. I knew this before going, but I can't say it didn't hurt not having disposable income. 

To sum it up: I think I made the right decision going here. I've seen the Ur-Example of Medicine, up close and personal. It's been painful, and I wish I got paid, but take the good with the bad.


Either way, I intend to emigrate to the UK, I don't really fit in, culturally or memetically speaking here, and after running the Rat Race and sort of winning, all I've become is Dr. Rat. 

Dr. Scott Alexander, of [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com) fame, inspired me to get into Psychiatry. (That and reasonable working hours!) I manged to miss my psychiatry rotation because all non-emergency admissions were closed while COVID was shaking out, but hey, it sure sounded nice. 

(He happened to see and reply the first time I posted this whopper, which admittedly has me tickled pink and awaiting the return of his regular posting.)


I hope that this account was somewhat illuminating, especially since I doubt this topic ever came up here.

Interesting case presentation- 30 something year old minimally responsive,"Hey guys, given the good response from the last [case](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/jslnwh/interesting_case_presentation_50_something_yo_man/) I posted, I wanted to keep this going. Again, this is a case not so much about the diagnosis (which is interesting), but the process of caring for this patient. This case will not have a good outcome like the last, but there are always important teaching points and learning points for myself with every case, good or bad. 

A little background information about me. I'm a US emergency medicine attending who works in a community/academic setting. This case is at a 45 bed 70,000 annual visit ER in a hospital that is part of a large system of hospitals in the city I live in. This hospital and ER is very well staffed, we have 12 nurses, 3 techs, an RT, there are 2 other attending ER docs on with me at the time and 1 medical student who is doing their EM rotation with me. My shift ends at 4am. 

So it is 0100, I am 3 hours away from the end of another uneventful shift. I only have three other active patients, all non-emergencies. As I am sitting at my computer, a nurse runs up to me and tells me they don't have a lot of information, but they are going to need my help in bed 7 immediately. 

I walk into the room as they are wheeling in a minimally responsive 30 something yo Hispanic male who is pale and breathing 45x a minute. His LLS score is positive. The report I got from the nurse that found him was that he was dropped off by some ""friends"" who didn't know his name or any of his medical problems. They said something about there being a lot of blood and then took off. 

The patient is confused, agitated, intermittently responsive, but unable to answer any questions. His shirt is already off, there is a small amount of dried blood on his abdomen, and some more on his jeans. 

Outside of obtaining vitals, **what is the first couple assessments you should be making in this patient?**

......

..........

..............

...................

........................

There are a couple answers for this, but the best answer is the ABC's of resuscitation, or airway, breathing, circulation, and importantly, exposing the patient. All we know is that the patient was dropped off, he is pale, looks like shit and likely on the verge of death, and there was reportedly ""a lot of blood"", so we should be considering trauma. His airway was patent as he intermittently screamed, he was severely tachypneic but breath sounds are normal and symmetrical, and he has faint pulses in all extremities w/ an absence of cap refill. We then cut his jeans and underwear off and quickly looked for any wounds including looking at his back and perineum. There was no evidence of any trauma to his body. Of note, his upper abdomen did appear to be distended. 

His initial VS were HR 111, BP 70/33, RR 45, O2 sat 99% on RA, T 35.6C. 

**What are you thinking as the likely diagnosis? What are the initial tests you want to order? And how are you going to immediately treat this patient?**

......

..........

..............

...................

........................

So I knew the diagnosis, immediately, but still wanted to cast a broad net in case I was wrong. I ordered a CBC, BMP, Liver profile, VBG, Type and cross for 8 units, lactic acid, coags, CXR, blood cultures. I also had our charge nurse run down to obtain 4 units of emergency release blood. The nurses caring for the patient immediately placed 2 18g IVs in bilateral arms. The blood that returned from the IV was like nothing I had ever seen before. It had the appearance and consistency of watered down red cool-aid. 

I had a nurse call the charge to tell her we are changing the emergency release order to a massive transfusion protocol. I also asked that we not bother with the blood cultures, as this individual was going to need every single RBC possible. I had my medical student do a quick FAST exam to make sure we were not missing a spontaneous splenic rupture. His FAST exam was negative for obvious intra-abdominal free fluid. There was a large amount of fluid in the patients stomach. This patient was clearly having a massive upper GI bleed.

So ignoring the severity of this case how do we typically medically manage undifferentiated acute upper GI bleeds in the ER?

......

..........

...................

........................

So there will be variance in practice, especially for the undifferentiated upper GI bleed; however, the most common therapies are proton pump inhibitors, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue), antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and pRBC transfusion using a transfusion threshold of hgb <7 g/dL.  

PPIs have no mortality benefit, but potentially reduce incidence of re-bleeding and need for surgical intervention in the management of bleeding peptic ulcers.^1 Given the lack of mortality benefit, PPIs are not a priority treatment in my practice, especially given that in the studies of the meta-analysis cited, PPIs were given after endoscopy. When they actually did study the timing of PPI administration (before vs after endoscopy), they found no difference in patient oriented outcomes.^2 It is also sufficient to give high dose PPIs (my typical dosing is 80mg of pantoprazole), rather than a bolus and drip during initial management, which in a case such as this is meaningful, as a drip means wasting a line on a drug that has no mortality benefit. I strongly suspected this was a esophageal or gastric variceal bleed, so I did not bother with a PPI.

Octreotide also has no mortality benefit, with its main benefit being a reduction of 0.7 units of pRBCs per patient it is used on.^3 The proposed mechanism for its effect is vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation so it should be reserved for patients where there is a high clinical suspicion for a variceal bleed. Typical dosing is IV bolus and drip (50mcg bolus, 25-50mcg/hr drip). Again, given the lack of mortality benefit, and in this case, taking up a line, this was certainly not a priority treatment in the massive upper GI bleed patient. 

Antibiotics for SBP ppx is one of the few therapies in upper GI bleeds (specifically cirrhotics with variceal bleeds), where there actually is a mortality benefit.^4 A third generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone is sufficient, typical dosing being 1-2g IV. I make sure to give all suspected cirrhotics (hx of significant alcohol intake, liver pathology, etc.) with an upper GI bleed a dose of antibiotics as this is definitely a priority therapy, although in this case, not as important as blood products. 

Transfusion thresholds of <7 g/dL for GI bleeds for the most part come from a single trial, the 2013 Villanueva trial. Here we found that a restrictive strategy for transfusion (7g/dL threshold) reduced incidence of mortality, bleeding, and adverse events compared to the liberal strategy for transfusion (9g/dL threshold). There was a few very important caveats to this study. The first is that every single patient in this trial received at minimum 1u of pRBCs. Per the trial's protocol, all patients received a unit of pRBCs prior to obtaining a hemoglobin level, and then received additional pRBCs if below their respective designated thresholds. The other caveat was that patients were excluded if they had a massive hemorrhage which was not defined and left up to the treating physicians.^5 This last caveat is important to remember, as a patient that is dying in front of you might have a Hgb of 8, but the liter of blood they just vomited might also have a hgb of 8, so recognize when you should deviate from protocol. This patient was obviously someone that would have been excluded from the trial.

**NOW BACK TO THE CASE**: VBG comes back with a pH 6.9, pCO2 20, HCO3 5, Lactic acid 45, and hgb was unable to be obtained. At this point I needed to make the decision of whether I should intubate or not. Intubating him would risk killing him due to any prolonged apnea time leading to near immediate death and being completely unable to match his minute ventilation on the vent and adding increased intrathoracic pressure leading to diminished venous return which would exacerbate his hemorrhagic shock. Not intubating him would mean gambling on whether he will vomit or not because if he vomits the contents of his stomach, there is a high probability he aspirates and dies, it also means I would be unable to place a cordis to assist in rapid transfusion due to how agitated he was. I chose to resuscitate him first rather than intubate. 

Another treatment I considered was tranexamic acid (TXA); however, the HALT-IT trial demonstrated a lack of benefit to TXA in GI bleed patients,^6 and I didn't want to take up another line for an ineffective treatment.

To assist with transfusion efforts, I placed bilateral IO lines in bilateral proximal humerus. While we were transfusing him, I got a call from lab that they could not run a CBC on him. Having experienced this before with low hemoglobin levels, I told them to report the results, as the sample was not diluted, it was legitimate. They stated they believed me, but the issue was that there was literally not enough RBCs to run a CBC. At this point I put out several calls to get some help with this patient including to our intensivist and on-call GI. The intensivist immediately came down to help with resuscitation so that I could discharge my other 3 patients so I could focus entirely on this one patient. Luckily I had 2 other ER docs on shift to help pick up the patients that continued to check in. It would have been a mess had I been by myself. 

Unfortunately, I realized who was on call for GI that night, and as usual with this one particular GI attending, he was of little assistance, stating ""well, if he is alive in the morning, I'll check on him, but it sounds like he needs to be resuscitated."" Of course, in his defense, this patient was sick AF, and to my understanding, current GI recommendations are to scope these patients within 13 hrs of presentation for high risk upper GI bleeds, and a recent NEJM trial demonstrated no mortality or transfusion difference in patients randomized to urgent vs early endoscopy (although this patient would have been excluded from the trial for being too unstable and would have received emergency endoscopy).^7 And unfortunately our IR docs will not perform TIPS unless GI has first performed an endoscopy first. 

I then get a call from blood bank that we are running out of emergency release blood (they only have 2u pRBCs left, as they used 20 units 2 nights before on another massive GI bleed), and they are unable to type the patient's blood due to not enough RBCs being present. At this point, the patient has received 4u pRBCs: 4u Plts: 4u FFP. I told them that we need to call around to get blood then because this guy still needed significantly more blood. I was then informed the patient's INR was >10 (important to note that INR levels are worthless for transfusion thresholds for FFP outside of coumadin use, and should not be used to guide therapy). This patient was receiving FFP not for their INR, but for balanced transfusion. 

The patient was now regaining a slight amount of color, his BP had improved to 90/50. This was now about two hours in, I decided that this was probably the appropriate time to take control of the patient's airway. I started the patient on peripheral levophed for the intubation, and drew up a syringe of epinephrine and diluted it to use as a push dose pressor. I made sure that we went straight from pre-oxygenation, to intubation rather than bagging due to the obvious risk of insufflating the stomach in someone with a massive amount of blood in it. The patient was intubated with the head of the bed at 45 degrees to reduce the risk of aspiration. I had our intensivist give a dose of the push dose pressor while I was placing the endotracheal tube. The intubation went successfully, thankfully.

The next concern was what to set the vent settings at. This was a patient that had extremely high minute ventilation prior intubation and still had a 6.9 pH, so we needed to try to match it as best we could. This is one of the few settings where I throw lung protective settings out the window and aim for higher tidal volumes. So I started this 5'3"" gentleman on 550mL tidal volume at a RR of 35 and advised the RT to repeat a gas in 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the intensivist placed a cordis so that we could expedite transfusion and placed an A-line. Nurses also placed an NG tube which put out 1.5L of blood.

We did draw slightly more blood for a repeat type and screen and CBC. His CBC came back this time with a hgb of 2.0 g/dL (the patient had 4.5 units pRBCs by this point). The patient was then whisked up to the ICU.

I spoke with the intensivist the next day. He ended up placing a Blakemore tube in the ICU as the patient deteriorated which was unsuccessful (I have very poor experiences with Blakemore tubes and find them to be largely useless, but that is a personal opinion). The blood bank ended up using the last of their emergency release blood on the patient, and prior to them obtaining more from surrounding hospitals, the patient coded and was pronounced approximately 10 hrs after he had arrived in the ER. They could not type and cross the patient due to almost all of his circulating RBCs being from donors. 

This was a very unfortunate case and there were certainly several less than ideal circumstances in this case that potentially could have lead to a better outcome in this patient, but in my experience, circumstances are almost never ideal.

Italian intensivists are circulating their experience with COVID-19. Their message: Get Ready!,"Dear Colleagues

Everyone is closely watching and monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak.  This global emergency is presenting major challenges for our profession as we attempt to anticipate, tackle and eventually get ahead of it. 

As there are many new experiences with this type of virus, we need to learn from those with more experience.  Information is vital.  As you will have seen, Northern Italy is in the middle of a crisis and Lombardy in particular has been severely affected.   Our colleagues coordinating the emergency ICU response in Northern Italy have sent me the following message which they wish to convey to all our members.I salute all the work our colleagues are doing, globally, faced with this situation.  ESICM will endeavor to do its part to share accurate information and resources.

Wishing you all the strength needed in the coming months,

Yours respectfully

Milan, 4 March 2020

*Dear friends,*

*At this moment in time, we believe it is important to share our first impressions and what we have learned in the first ten days of the COVID-19 outbreak.*

*We have seen a very high number of ICU admissions, almost entirely due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.*

*The surge can be important during an outbreak and cluster containment* *has to be in place* *to slow down virus transmission.*

*We are seeing a high percentage of positive cases being admitted to our Intensive Care Units, in the range of* ***10% of all positive patients***\*.\*

*We wish to convey a strong message: Get ready!*

*We also want to share with you some key points from our experience:*

* Get ready now - with your ICU’s networks - to define your **contingency plan** in the event of an outbreak in your community
* Don’t work “in silo”. Coordinate with your hospital management and other healthcare professionals to prepare your response
* Make sure your hospital management and procurement office have a **protocol** in place about **which personal protection equipment (PPE) to stock and re-stock**
* Make sure your staff is trained in **donning and doffing procedures**
* Use **education, training and simulation** as much as possible
* **Identify early hospitals** that can manage the initial surge in a safe way
* **Increase your total ICU capacity**
* Get ready to **prepare ICU areas** where to cohort COVID-19 + patients - in every hospital if necessary
* Put in place a **triage protocol** to identify suspected cases, test them and direct them to the right cohort
* Make sure you **set clear goals** for care with the patients and their families early on

*With our best regards*

"To those of you entering the profession or working your way here, the art of medicine is more important than the science of medicine","There is no doubt you will be well educated and well trained in the science of medicine. Statins post stroke, pneumovax to reduce lung abscesses, CAR-T for cancer, but I want you to start focusing on the human condition. This is not an exhaustive list by any means but is a start at how we should think of our fellow humans. I’m a hospitalist so I will try to only speak to what I know. Other specialties feel free to add.

Alcohol is not a problem. It is a solution to a problem. Don’t get frustrated that the alcoholic won’t stop if we don’t help with the problem.

On hospital day three of their pneumonia admission, your ten point review of systems is a lie. I propose a ten point review of who they are. Knowing who they are can sometimes give you better insight to their illness and sometimes just make the relationship stronger. Example, my dying cancer patient loved Texas hold em, playing a couple hands on day 20 before he died was more important than any ROS, exam, or meds I could give him.

Everybody around you is unique with their own anxieties and problems. That person who just got off the elevator, they might have just lost their newborn. That person who slammed the bathroom door might have just found out their spouse has cancer, that angry nurse might have a kid with special needs at home, that person holding up the cafeteria line might have just been told that their partner has Alzheimer’s. Be kind to everybody, the hospital is a very special place.

Don’t turn your back to the patient and type. Don’t stand up hovering over the bedside. Don’t not give silence a chance. These things are way more important than an S3. 

Don’t overvalue the risk of death. Specifically speaking about PEGs. Sometimes it’s ok to accept aspiration if death is not valued over eating. Better yet, don’t villainize vices at the end of life.

Opiates treat pain but cause suffering. Unless you are dying. BZDs cause way more anxiety when you try to remove them than the anxiety you were trying to treat in the first place.

Don’t lie to your patients. If they don’t take their asa, they won’t die. Learn how to couch it better or analogize it better. The odds are in their favor if they don’t take asa, but if they didn’t take it and got an MI would they regret it? Then it’s a discussion about regret mitigation. Whatever their choice, you’ll both be less frustrated and they will feel more respected and you will get more respect. Don’t lie.

Short of physically assaulting you, any abuse you get from patients or families is usually not personal and is the expression of the vulnerability and fear. Do stand up for yourself but give them the benefit of the worst of ourselves when dealing with the betrayal of our bodies.

Your career is an ongoing prospective trial with an n of one. Your value is standing up for the 95% of your practice that you can back up with your own well reasoned decisions. Don’t be dogmatic. 5% of your value comes from the margins of cognitive dissonance. If you don’t look, you will never see.

You are the right person for the job.

Last but most important. On death. We all die. We don’t all die the same way. Sometimes we die slowly on a vent and suffer to give our family the time to come to peace. Sometimes we take chemo for regret mitigation other times because we want our kids to know we didn’t quit even though we know we are dying. Sometimes our lives are robbed in the night and our families never get to say goodbye. The discussion around and about death is the most nuanced discussion you will ever have. Put your values aside. Ask questions and listen. Their motivations for delaying death are sometimes very meaningful and understandable even if you don’t agree with it. Don’t place the burden of removal of life support on the family, it’s not fair. Love and fear cannot hear reason.

The day you have no anxiety walking through those hospital doors is the day you hang it up.

Edit1: none of this is to say 95% of our job is not science a delivery of sound and safe practices. It’s in the margins of our job where science doesn’t explain the humanity of us all that we strive to excel and are called upon to deliver compassion. For the health of our patient yes, but also, more importantly, for our own health.

Edit2: my take on the abuse of residency isn’t a justification of other docs shitty behavior towards residents. If we accept the reality of shitty people and focus on learning how to face it we will have trained more resilient physicians. If you get humiliated during morning report, GOOD, take inventory of your ability to present and the holes in your knowledge. But it isn’t  advice to not stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself doesn’t always mean going toe to toe with a curmudgeon, sometimes you stand up for yourself by being a better version of yourself. I have worked with all kinds of attendings, the ones with pure animus are far and few between. But on the wards in a high stakes environment tempers will fly. Again not at all advocating for the abuse of another human being. I am advocating for the training of resilient human beings facing incredible odds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/d4ard6/to_those_of_you_entering_the_profession_or/,2019-09-14 20:44:30,tanda

How to deal with lack of empathy to Covid-19 patients?,"Self explanatory post.

Dealing with the current surge has been very difficult.

I have no empathy whatsoever to covid-19 patients during this current surge.

I used to early in the pandemic and before the vaccine but now I feel nothing.

I still treat them well, practice the standard of care medicine and wish them improvement but deep inside I can't care less if they actually make it or not.

If they deteriorate? Oh well tough potatoe. You chose this. You did this to yourself. No one to blame for your own suffering but yourself.

I hate feeling this way but I can't help but feel resentment for them filling up our hospital, taking beds from other sick patients and wasting resources that shouldn't have been wasted if they took the damn vaccine.

Update:
I really appreciate everyone's input.

When I rounded on my patients today I actually felt less resentful and more sincere and wishful for their recovery.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/p70nx6/how_to_deal_with_lack_of_empathy_to_covid19/,2021-08-18 21:27:38,tanda
In Defense of PSA Screening,"Urologist here and I wanted to provide you with the most up to date information on prostate cancer screening. I'll give the quick TLDR version up top, then go much more into depth down below.  

**TLDR: I believe that we should be offering PSA screening (every 2-4 years) for men aged 50-70.**

**The best available evidence suggests that with 16-18 years off follow up  you will prevent one death from prostate cancer and 2 cases of metastatic disease for every 110 - 500 men you offer screening to, and 7-18 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (not necessarily treated) to prevent one mortality**

This compares favorably to mammography (number needed to offer screening to prevent one death 370-950 depending on when you start screening), colonoscopy ( number needed to offer screening \~870 to prevent one death), and low dose lung CT (number needed to screen 320)

Going just on clinical data, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis has doubled since the USPSTF recommendation, and prostate cancer mortality rates have plateaud despite the invention of pretty impressive new therapies that extend life (novel hormonal agents like abiretarone, enzalutamide, etc)

The long version:

There are 3 main prostate cancer randomized screening trials. The PLCO (American trial), the ERSPC (European multinational screening trial), and the Goteborg trial (Swedish PSA RCT), which is somewhat confusing because part but not all of their data is included in the ERSPC trial.

When the USPSTF made their Grade D recommendation for prostate cancer in 2012, we only had the 10 year results from PLCO and ERSPC to go on.  The problem is that is at 10 years from randomization, not from prostate cancer diagnosis. Average length of diagnosis was only 5 years. The natural history of prostate cancer is such that almost all people will live > 10 years after their localized prostate cancer diagnosis, and most will live > 15 years. As such, the PLCO trial showed no difference in Prostate cancer mortality's while the ERSPC did show a mortality reduction, but you needed to offer screening to 1300 people and diagnose 49 people to prevent one death.

  We also now know these studies are incredibly flawed. In the American study, the PLCO, over 40% of men had PSA screening before the trial.  Of those who were screened and recommended biopsy, over 40% didn't comply.  And more impressively, **there was actually more PSA testing done in the control arm then the PSA screening arm**. This occurred because the trial took place in an era where PSA screening rapidly caught on from being a novelty to being standard of care. Unfortunately, it makes the results more or less worthless

The ERSPC trial also had some of these issues but to a lesser extent. Pre screening with PSA ranged from 1-40% depending on the site, biopsy compliance was higher (85%), screening in the control arm was still a big problem (up to 60%) but much less then in the PLCO.  Even with these caveats, the 16 year follow up data that released from the ERSPC showed that you needed to invite 570 men to screen to prevent one death and diagnose 18 men. Furthermore, the benefit was amplified on men who actually followed protocol. For the screening arm as a whole, the mortality reduction was 21%. For those who got 2 or more PSA tests, the mortality reduction was almost 50%. This data (the number needed to screen) will continue to improve as longer follow up occurs, as most of the prostate cancer mortality is likely yet to occur.

Interestingly there is a sub-analysis of the ERSPC, the Dutch cohort. This was the initial site in the trial, and as such has the longest follow up, the lowest rates of PSA pre screening (only 1%) and the lowest rates of PSA contamination in the control arm (only 6%). They found a 58% reduction is PCSM with a number needed to invite to screen of 101 to prevent one death, and **you only had to offer PSA screening to 67 men to prevent once case of metastatic prostate cancer**. The main limitation is that this was in a small sample size by screening standards (1100 men)

But wait, there is more.  The Goteborg trial (RCT in Sweden) also had much lower PSA pre-screening and PSA contamination then in the ERSPC trial. They found at 18 years follow up you needed to invite 190 men to get a PSA screen to prevent one death. Looking at men who actually got screened, you had to get 139 men PSA screening to prevent one death.

**While the data varies somewhat between the study, an interesting finding is that the better the study (longer follow up, better compliance, lower contamination) the better PSA screening looks. That suggests the benefit is greater then the ERSPC trial suggests.** 

As a Urologist I obviously have a bias here and stake in this fight, but it is also because I see the downsides.  Mortality benefits aside, even the quality of life burden of metastatic prostate cancer (it loves bones) is immense. We are already seeing a dramatic rise in metastatic prostate cancer incidence , likely due to the USPSTF decision. And while the data has evolved since then, the conversation hasn't seemed to.

Take home points:

**PSA screening in appropriate patients (men aged 50-70) saves lives at equivalent or higher rates then any other cancer screening, though there is a cost of increased diagnosis of indolent prostate cancer.**

**The mortality benefit is not going to be seen for > 10 years, so do not screen men with a <10 or even 15 year life expectancy,**

**Since these trials have been run, there have been some key changes.** 

**First we now recommend surveillance (and not treatment) for low risk prostate cancer. This helps us maintain the benefit of PSA screening while minimizing the treatment burden (though there is still a burden of surveillance in how we follow these men)**

**Second we now have the technology of prostate MRI prior to biopsy. This has been demonstrated to improve detection rates of higher risk prostate cancers, and actually reduce the detection rate of low risk prostate cancer. This is likely to reduce the number of cases needed to diagnose to prevent one life and may amplify the mortality benefit, but this remains unproven.**

**Third is we now have better treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer. It is unclear what effect this has on the benefits of PSA screening, as it may extend the natural treatment history of prostate cancer, but also improve outcomes in those who receive local therapy, so the impact here is unclear.**

Edit: this last point is also key from a cost benefit standpoint. The novel hormonal agents are great drugs (effective, well tolerated, etc.) but extremely expensive. The cost of a novel hormonal agent (abiretarone, enzalutamid, apilutamide, darolutamide, etc) is approximately 100k/year. And most patients will be on them for a median of 5 years. So in the last decade, metastatic prostate cancer has gotten exceptionally expensive, and the cost benefit of preventing one case is massive. 

**PCPs. Please screen your patients!**

"Finally able to speak to spokesman from UAPD (Physician's Union), here's what I found out","Long post, so buckle up.

I posted awhile back about making some surveys so doctors can anonymously voice support for prospective unions at their hospitals. Before I did that, I wanted to speak to the UAPD spokesman myself, so that I can help walk any interested physicians through the process without having to reach out to the UAPD directly until they have something a bit more solid to show for. We talked for quite awhile and he walked me through the process, complications, and what kind of ""extracurricular"" work would be required to form one (spoiler: not a whole lot on an individual level). It's against sub rules to post surveys here, so I will post those only in other medical subs. Physician's that contacted me & UAPD earlier will be contacted directly by me, and once again to them especially, thanks for taking direct action to end the trend of us getting stepped on.

I will list the key findings that I think will be high-yield to actual physicians, who can form actual unions. Ask away with any questions, I'll answer as best I can. And please, do yourself and your profession a favor and have these conversations with colleagues you trust as the Corona mess winds down a bit near you, and then take steps to formally unionize. That's the only way things get better. Do not act on hospital administrators' behalf by refusing to *act* on your own behalf.

Note: I am a dumbass med student, not a lawyer, not a union spokesperson, or anything else like it. I have also paraphrased in some places because the legal stuff is a rabbit hole and a half, though I will clear up nuances in the comments as necessary.

# Which physicians can unionize?

* Private practice - cannot unionize; doing so would be racketeering

* Public employee physicians (e.g. work for university hospital) - generally can, with varying restrictions on details by state law

* Private hospital employee physicians - essentially always can 

Laws governing unions are mainly provided by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and various similar state laws. The group of people that are eligible to unionize together form an Appropriate Bargaining Unit (ABU).

**Very important: to enjoy NLRA protections, you must be a union member. You cannot just hold an impromptu walkout. This is a crime, or at least grounds for board sanctions, since you will have abandoned patients.** Unions strike, individual just up and walk out.

-----

# Who makes makes up an ABU (i.e. who is eligible to join)?

Per NLRA, employees that form *functionally* the same role for the same employer make up the ABU. Keep in mind through-out that these laws were written for factory workers, not doctors, so view all of this through the lens that those same laws will be applied to us.

* hospital MD/DOs - obviously they're in the doctor's union

* doctors in the same city, different employer - need a separate union

* doctors at different hospitals, same employer - could go either way legally, there are factory examples of both; ask yourself if it makes sense for the negotiations to apply to both hospitals' doctors

* doctors with same employer, different city - likely need separate unions; e.g. cost of living likely differs

* NP/PAs at same hospital - likely to be eligible

* RNs, CNAs, PharmDs - likely need a separate union

* part-time doctors - likely eligible

* locums doctors - likely eligible

* MD/DOs in clerical or management roles - uneligible if they're more administrative than clinical

* those damn neurosurgeons I hate consulting - definitely eligible, suck it up

There are laws that allow multi-departmental (e.g. MD/DO + RN) or multi-employer unions, but this more complicated, and often involves mergers of existing separate unions.

-----

# Why eligibility matters

* **30% of the labor force (ABU) must sign an ""authorization card"" to allow the union-to-be to take action to legally force the employer to recognize it.**

* The % of the ABU that has signed auth cards directly determines the strength of union, and how likely UAPD is to prioritize forming your union (note: you do not need 30% before contacting them, see below).

* If you assume the size of your ABU and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) disagrees, that could put you below 30%

## What UAPD wants

* ~10 interested doctors that are on-board to contact UAPD, and to discreetly talk to more MD/DO/PA/NPs to get them on-board **(that is essentially your biggest time committment)**

* Any information you can glean about the size of your physician/midlevel workforce

  * info about full-time vs. part-time vs. locums is helpful

  * this is why I'm trying to make surveys

* an ""organizational flowchart"" outlining management structure from floor managers to CEO; they recommended asking a manager about this one (this is what MBAs get off on doing, so it likely exists)

-----

# Ain't no NP/PA joining my union

In short, too damn bad. Swallow our pride for our own good.

1. **Legally speaking, they perform the same role as physicians. You could not convince the NLRB that employed welder's apprentices are not production workers just because they require oversight, so you likely can't convince them that NP/PAs aren't allowed in the club either**

2. If you were to choose to not let them in, they would still be in the denominator of the 30% you need (i.e. you're less likely to get enough to unionize)

3. more people = more power. If you refuse to let them in, you're shooting your long-term prospects in the foot for short-term smug satisfaction

4. When you try to legally declare the union, or later on to strike, the hospital will just hire/give raises to the NP/PAs that you kept out of the club.

5. **There is nothing saying that their equal vote guarantees equal status/pay.** When the union negotiates, the welding apprentices don't get paid like welders. Hierarchies can be worked out in union negotiations *once the union exists.*

-----

# Legal Steps to Declare a Union

Items in italics are legal requirements, everything else is how UAPD runs things.

1. imagine an estimated 1000-person workforce (scale for your hospital)

2. The 10 interested doctors contact UAPD, hopefully with the materials discussed earlier (if you can get them)

3. They tell each to doctor discreetly recruit 4-5 eligible members. Report back when you have 50.

4. This process repeats, until you have 550 members (55% of ABU- they do this to ensure *30%*). UAPD is contact to help manage issues the whole time

5. **They set up offices near you and draft legal documents preparing to declare the union**

6. Ideally during this time, you've all managed to get 650-700 people (no less than 550) willing to *sign authorization cards. Then you do so.*

7. *UAPD contacts NLRB*, at this time the hospital will likely become aware of prospective union, and panic

8. The employer will do anything to invalidate the 30% before the vote. Hire lawyers, run smear campaigns, offer to make concessions if physician's tear up their cards or vote no. They often attempt illegal acts, too: bribery, threats, you name it. **Do not back down, do not concede. As a rule, if admin is scared, it's because you're winning.** Record (check state laws) all conversation or get it in writing. Threats/bribes should be reported, and are grounds for suits.

9. *NLRB orders a vote*

10. *If 50%+1 of voters are in favor, the union is legally in force. The NLRA now dictates what admins can (not) do. Negotiations begin.*

-----

# Oh God don't stop, I'm almost there

It gets better, *big boy.*

* They can no longer fire you.

* They can't change anything up for negotiation that was previously in force: your pay, your hours, your super secret physician's lounge amenities (stripper pole, or so I'm told)

* They are forced by law to negotiate with you, they can't go elsewhere to hire

* They can't refuse to negotiate - no ""take it or leave it tactics"" *by law*

* everything is up for negotiation, even the type of soap in the bathrooms

-----

# What about what we want?

* Once agreements are made with admin, it must past a 50%+1 union vote to become effective (salaries, hours, patient loads)

* This means not everything may fit you 100%, but IMO this beats negotiating for yourself, at an informational and tactical disadvantage

* On the flip side, that means that if UAPD reps are convinced you're getting a good deal but you don't buy it, nothing can be shoved down your throat without passing a vote

* You cannot be forced to sign a union auth card, nor be forced to join even if it passes vote

-----

# Dues

* UAPD is 501(c)3, so they subsist off of dues

* In right to work states, union members cannot forced to pay dues unless a Collective Bargaining Agreement is voted into effect

* They are legally required to provide members with documentation of how dues are spent

* **Dues = 0.9% of gross monthly salary** ($75/mo ($900/yr) for every $100K of yearly gross salary)
 
  * This is low, so I'm told, since doctors make more (and thus pay more) vs. other industries.

  * I checked this myself. In other industries, it seems like common dues are 1.2-2.5%

  * Nat'l Nurses United/California Nurses Association requires the equivalent of 2.2 hours of pay per month

    * Take your yearly pay in thousands, and divide it in half. This is your equivalent hourly rate working 40 hr/wk, 50 wk/yr (e.g. $100K/yr = $50/hr)

    * In the RN union case, they ask for 2.2 hrs of pay per month, or 26.4 hrs/yr. Since that standard work year is 2000 hours, that means the nurses union requires 26.4/2000 = *1.32% of gross salary, paid on a monthly basis*

That's all I have to start. Please lob questions ad lib, there's a lot I didn't cover, and I'll answer whatever I'm capable of. Please have these conversations with colleagues. All of our talk here only matters when we act on it. If anyone is interested and wants more info, or gets some people together and wants a bit of guidance as you prepare to reach out to UAPD, PM me and we can talk privately. **UAPD wants to see 10 interested people. If you can manage that, they'll shoulder much of the burden from there. That's all it takes to make it to start to make it real at your hospital.**

Remember: this may be the one time in our lives/careers and where we have public sympathy, open evidence of administrative overreach and mismanagement, and broad physician consensus that the status quo must change. Do not let it pass quietly by. If you try, and it goes nowhere, you've wasted several hours. If you don't try, and the moment passes, you have the rest of your career to wonder what might have been.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ggemrk/finally_able_to_speak_to_spokesman_from_uapd/,2020-05-09 12:29:58,tanda
Am I being selfish?,"Created a throw away account for this one. I'm a family physician in a large US city where I am one of just two physicians who speak an uncommon African language. As a result, 99% of my patients speak this language and about half are refugees. Both me and the other guy are no longer accepting new patients. I am really grateful that my services are needed, my patients are grateful that they can express themselves to me in their native language, but I'm burnt out by the fee for service model. I have adjusted my practice to fit this model, but I feel like 75% of my brain during the visit is trying to conclude the visit, bill for it, and move on to the next patient before I'm late. When I'm addressing a patient's problems, I feel a mix of reward because I am solving their problem, satisfaction because know nobody else could be giving this level of care, gratitude for their trusting me to address their problem, but there are also threads of frustration and resentment that the visit is dragging on. I feel like the system is built to force me to water down the care just enough to complete the tasks and then get the patient out of there. And this is obviously negatively impacting the visit for me and the patient. No complaints from patients so far, but it sucks to feel that I'm hurrying them out the door.  I can't lower the ammount of patients I'm seeing for financial reasons - I earn as much as my peers, but I'm seeing more patients to get there. I live in a modest house, drive a 10 year old car, but have medical school debt. 

I dream of doing a DPC model or concierge care where I'd have more time, like 30-60 minute visits. But no matter how cheap I make it, it's still more than free for my refugee patients. And I think my feeling is that medical care shouldn't be this thing that is made to be as cheap as possible. We deserve care that is not hurried.... I could easily convert to a DPC practice, I've worked out the mechanics of it, etc, but I can't ignore the fact that it would leave all these patients to be forced to do visits with interpreters (lets face it, it sucks for both physician and patient). Essentially by definition, I'd be excluding patients who need my care the most. And if I do a hybrid model, there is still a big chunk that will be pushed out and I don't even know how I'd make the decision to see one person or the other.  Having my fee for service patients leave by attrition is also a bad way to do it in my oppinion.  In summary, I feel like I'm being forced to choose between delivering hurried care at an exhausting pace or kicking patients out of my practice who won't be able to get similar care. I'm sure many of you have been in a similar situation and I'd appreciate your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/lpv82j/am_i_being_selfish/,2021-02-22 18:04:04,rewa
"Hydroxychloroquine works for COVID-19, trust me!","It seems like the goalposts for proving that hydroxychloroquine is beneficial continues to move.

First they showed it inhibits Sars-Cov-2 in-vitro, but obviously we know that doesn't necessarily translate in-vivo

The initial study that showed its benefit wasn't well controlled and randomised.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549

And when we did do randomised controlled trials it showed no benefit.

[RECOVERY TRIAL](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR2vg7IV5MhTS_gH4QXERwFJN03wS7fREdb0QB11NBfbYsg4nvR4qVKja7M)


People have also suggested combining it with azithromycin or zinc but there was still no benefit.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2019014 (With azithromycin)

Only retrospective studies have been done for zinc



And then we found that the numbers needed to harm vs save was too high due to risk of lengthened QT interval.

But people still insisted on using it very early on it the illness which still didn't work. 

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207


And then using it as prophylaxis which is just stupid as it's basically akin to moderate strength chemotherapy. And it still didn't work.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.20197327v1

So really, where else is there to go with this drug? It's been proven ineffective multiple times over, harmful in some cases and we've actually found other things that can work like steroids and anticoagulation.

For a drug whose mechanism of action is still not fully known, a lot of people sure do put a lot of faith in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/iyckyh/hydroxychloroquine_works_for_covid19_trust_me/,2020-09-23 15:43:35,goa

* **Case Doubling Time (Non-China):** 4 days [18](https://coronainfo.xyz/)

* **Transmission Methods:** Respiratory droplet and touch/fomites [6](https://bit.ly/2VvvSAY), possible fecal-oral [21](https://wb.md/388zwDt), possible airborne (conditional) [28](https://bit.ly/2VynbWr)

* **Incubation Period:** 2-14 days [7](https://bit.ly/2T9cOXS)

* **Persistence on Inanimate Surfaces:** Highly dependent on surface and conditions. *Possibly* up to 9 days, but generally less than that [27](https://bit.ly/395aXIW),[29](https://bit.ly/3akp2CJ)

**Symptoms:** Fever, cough, SOB [8](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html). *It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.* After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about **20% of patients requiring hospital treatment**. Notably, the COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat [9](https://bit.ly/2VCYOH8). Some atypical patients [may present](https://bit.ly/2TsQOWA) initially with GI symptoms.

**Clinical Features**: 
Clinical presentation among reported cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness. Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness. In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days. Between 23–32% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required intensive care for respiratory support. [30](https://bit.ly/2PzOzzD)

Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent *serious* manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Most infections are not severe, although many patients have had critical illness. In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity, 81 percent were mild (no or mild pneumonia). In a study involving patients with pneumonia, ""**lymphopenia** was common, and all patients had parenchymal lung abnormalities on computed tomography of the chest, including bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities. ... Among the six patients who died, D-dimer levels were higher and lymphopenia was more severe compared with survivors. [23](https://bit.ly/32ytr2b)

**Treatment**:

Healthcare personnel should care for patients in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection should be used when caring for the patient. ... The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, home isolation, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. ... No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. **Clinical management includes prompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures and supportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated.** [31](https://bit.ly/2VwMvfu)

**Corticosteroids should be avoided** unless indicated for other reasons (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock per Surviving Sepsis guidelinesexternal icon), because of the potential for prolonging viral replication as observed in MERS-CoV patients.

* Fever or signs/symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g. cough or shortness of breath) **AND** Any person, including health care workers, who has had close contact) with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient within 14 days of symptom onset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR

* Fever and signs/symptoms of a lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) requiring hospitalization **AND** A history of travel from affected geographic areas within 14 days of symptom onset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR

* Fever with severe acute lower respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia, ARDS) requiring hospitalization and without alternative explanatory diagnosis (e.g., influenza) **AND** *No source of exposure has been identified*

**How to test:** Healthcare providers should immediately notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a COVID-19 PUI case investigation form available below.

**Death Rate Stats:**

Note that the following tables are based on information from Chinese CDC and derived from data on documented cases in the Chinese Infectious Disease Information System. The data is biased since it is derived from patients who were sick enough to be treated and documented by the Chinese health system. The actual numbers may be very different. Particularly, the death rate by pre-existing condition is likely to be much lower overall.

First flu fuck you,"What the hell is going on. I’m 5 days in and this is just getting worse and worse. I’m 6ft 180pounds and the last 5 days I think I haven’t eaten over 200 calories of food per day. The worst part is if I put my blanket on, my whole bed gets soaked in sweat but if I take it off for a second I turn into a icicle. 
-Does anyone know if it helps getting the vaccine while you already caught it? I wouldn’t wish this much fever, sweats, body ache or dry coughs to even trump.
- I honestly thought I was feeling sick from vaping and weed cartridges after all these stories on the news but it’s def the flu",https://www.reddit.com/r/flu/comments/def8ye/first_flu_fuck_you/,2019-10-07 05:41:30,vapi
And now bronchitis!,"I had to go to VA clinic for a renal ultrasound.  They called me, said come in Saturday because fewer sick people.  I said I have flu, but getting better, they said it's fiiiiine.

So we get there. Last night my fever was up to 100.0, I still have a hard dry cough, and pulse oxygen level according to my phone sensor ranging between 92% and 97%.  We go in wearing masks for the sake of all.

Ultrasound tech comes out and says since I'm symptomatic, I need to drive 25 miles to the big VA hospital (thankfully less traffic due to stay home orders!)  I get there, they have a triage tent set up.  They take vitals, check me in, give me a wristband.  I tell them I'm just there for a standard ultrasound, but they say because I have symptoms, I need to go through procedure.  Cool cool.

Upshot is, no ultrasound until completely asymptomatic, and oh, BTW, your flu is now bronchitis and will take an additional month to resolve.   😡

At least they gave me benzonatate for my cough, it is awesome!  Meanwhile, my kidneys hurt, and the clinic's radiology department will be getting a call from their bosses about demanding I go in for that test!",https://www.reddit.com/r/flu/comments/fmtafi/and_now_bronchitis/,2020-03-22 03:41:07,tanda
Pain first then fever then congestion?,"Has anyone had an experience like this? It started a week ago with bad lower body aches that just hit randomly and turned into deep bone pain that radiated from ass to knees. I thought I was sore from moving days before but then I got a low grade fever and chills. Lasted for two days, negative flu test and then came the congestion, stuffy snotty nose and chest mucus. Sunday my temp hit 103 and I felt horrific. Positive flu test. Got on tamiflu ASAP and Monday was a bit better. Each day has progressively been milder. It’s Thursday now a week since those first pains and I feel pretty good other than some lingering nose snot and occasional chest gunk. I’ve been fever free since Monday and I have energy, appetite, voice almost back etc. I have 3 doses left on the tamiflu. Does it sound like my journey was unusual or is this kind of standard too? How much longer should I wait before I start doing life stuff again?",https://www.reddit.com/r/flu/comments/eiywoi/pain_first_then_fever_then_congestion/,2020-01-02 14:31:28,tanda

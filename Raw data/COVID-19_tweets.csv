COVID-19,23,"DO NO HARM - OR 'SAVING' THEMSELVES?On March 12th, 2020, I wrote: ""Ventilators kill if not used appropriately, and for COVID 19 - there is never an appropriate time"" And yet they continued to execute people every day for three years and counting. Why? Just Following Orders?Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia was a driver for mortality - found in a new study from April 2023. ""Unsuccessful treatment of VAP is associated with greater mortality."" They always knew what was killing most patients. Yet ventilators and refused antibiotics continue to this day. David Dickson March 12, 2020 “Ventilators kill if not used appropriately, and for COVID 19 - there is never an appropriate time. But let's buy more especially from those experts in the medical equipment field such as vacuum cleaner and car manufacturers… Will they go through years of double-blind studies to make sure they are safe?” April 5, 2020 “Why does the world suddenly need millions of ventilators, when doctors continue to report that almost if not all patients who are intubated and placed on a ventilator ultimately die? What then is the point? Yet the cry for ventilators, masks and gloves is relentless. All of these are suddenly in short supply. All because of PANIC, hoarding and international health directives.” “Test kits started arriving and lock downs went into effect, one country after another. Doctors were panicking about being infected so followed international guidelines on INTUBATED ventilation instead of using masks or cannulas for oxygen. This is pretty much fatal for a pneumonia patient and ventilation is typically for someone with an inability to breathe mechanically, not for an issue with oxygen exchange in the lungs. Even in those without pneumonia, intubated ventilation can cause pneumonia and a loss of oxygen exchange, typically in 25%+ of cases. They even have a name for it - VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia). Pneumonia  Age  Pre-Existing Conditions = Bodies start stacking up.” April 9, 2020 ""The next step, as per the Canadian Guidelines, would be to intubate me causing VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia)*."" (Based on direction from  the WHO). ""I would then drown as my lungs filled up due to the pressure induced VAP"" ""Four months ago, I would receive pain medication and oxygen (as needed) through a cannula (nasal tube). I would have x-rays and antibiotics and be back with my family in a day or less."" May 7, 2020  “In the case of COVID 19 and ventilators, doctors who are supporting and condoning an active role in the clear misuse of ventilators are essentially killing their patients.” “From death by ventilator and a failure to use a known cheap treatment (Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin) to the lockdown induced deaths from heart attacks, diabetes, stroke, suicide and more, we are slowly suffocating while being 'gas' lighted by the media daily.” Speaking of Hydroxychloroquine All articles published in 2020 here. And how do we know they knew they were killing COVID patients? The biggest voice for early ventilation in Alberta admitted it in April 2021 and still continued to put people on early ventilation. Note the Average age of COVID Deaths at the time this was written. 82 years old! ""Very early on in this, we realized that there was a strong age cutoff to COVID where you didn’t survive if you got put on a ventilator. The studies made it clear that if you’re over 80 on a vent, you would die."""

COVID-19,49,"China #Economy Update - 19 May 2023#China expected their economy to fully recover after they lifted the lockdown implemented over Covid-19.  Q1 in 2023, showed promising results. However the first month in Q2 (#April2023) - the economy has run out of steam and is tanking.China’s economy is viewed through the lens of numerous financial indicators including it’s imports and exports, and it’s manufacturing. The economy was surging pre-covid thanks to a property bubble, which has been burst now that debt facilities for large property development companies such as Evergrand have now been pulled and the property market and investment in properties has fallen off a cliff, and the appetite for consumers to buy properties has tanked.Imports fell by a whopping -7.9% in April indicating a drop in a drop in Chinese #manufacturing and domestic demand (it imports it’s raw materials from abroad). Exports dropped sharply from 48% in 2021 to 14.8% in March, and now down to just 8.5% in April 2023, an example is the drop in imports from South Korea, down by 25%. A fall in imports is a global concern, as this means China may not be able to service demand in the future. This will also mean a drop in GDP for China, who warns of a complicated period ahead as many of it’s export markets are facing a risk of recession.#Production output is in positive territory for April, the slowdown in imports is yet to materialise at factory level. However the 6.5% realised is around half of what they had projected at the start of the year - being 10.9%, in order to meet their predictions for GDP growth in 2023. The manufacturing sector, which employs about 18% of China’s workforce, remains under pressure due to slack global demand. Some exporters told Reuters at the country’s biggest trade fair they have frozen investments and some have cut labor costs in response.The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) declined to 49.2 from 51.9 in March, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, below the 50-point mark that separates expansion and contraction in activity on a monthly basis. The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, on Friday stressed that restoring and expanding demand is the key to a durable recovery. In reality, anti-Chinese product sentiment across the democratic and civilised world has lost it’s appetite for doing business with a dictatorship that has over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps, and has demonstrated a belligerent foreign policy attitude and raised armed conflict tensions with the West over it’s wrongful claim that Taiwan needs to be brought in under the CCP’s rule on the mainland. China’s support for Russia demonstrated by it supply of aid to Russia in it’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has created concern and disdain for the Chinese and Chinese products across the globe, and this looks to materialise in even less business being down with China over the coming decades.The property market has fallen off a cliff, it is done -16.2%, down from March’s -7.2%. This has happened since the CCP introduced legislation to prevent developers from becoming over-leveraged, a prime example being Evergrand which has accumulated over $300 Billion in #debt. Multiple crises since mid-2020 have included developers’ debt defaults and stalled construction of pre-sold housing projects. 25% of the Chinese economy is in the property market. A good measure of this market is in the amount of bank loans being provided to manufacturers and property buyers. It is down 82% from March!Please see my other thread highlighting the 160 Trillion Yuan local government debt pile that is equivalent to China’s annual GDP, maturing between now and 2027, which they can’t afford to pay for.Ps.

COVID-19,1,"Publication #2: Changes in Consumption in the Early COVID-19 Era: Zip-Code Level Evidence from the U.S.Using monthly zip-code level data on credit card transactions covering 16 U.S. cities, this paper investigates changes in consumption at local commercial places during the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. Since using aggregate-level data can suppress valuable information on consumption patterns coming from zip codes, the main contribution is achieved by estimating common factors across zip codes that are controlled for factors that are zip-code and time specific as well as those that are zip-code and sector specific. The estimation results based on common factors across zip codes show that relative consumption of products and services that can be consumed at home (e.g., grocery, pharmacy, home maintenance) has increased up to 56% amid COVID-19 compared to the previous year, whereas relative consumption of products and services that cannot be consumed at home (e.g., fuel, transportation, personal care services, restaurant) has decreased up to 51%. Similarly, after controlling for the corresponding factors, online shopping has increased up to 21%, while its expenditure share has increased by up to 16% compared to the pre-COVID-19 period.Publication is available at Blog post is available at More papers are available at"

COVID-19,13,"3 years ago on this date, I spent my first night in a police ""detention"" room. Since it's Friday, I thought a mini sequel to the 'Life of a “MUSINZI” in Covid19 confinement' story was best fitting. Before I go on, I would like to appreciate  who was at the time the CTO of  and the current IGP Felix Namuhoranye who was at the time the DCGP of  . They both played key roles in following up on my case.I realised that I had never written what happened right after publishing the story, and before you think that I suffer from stockholm syndrome, you can quickly scroll through my last rantings and complains to see that it is not the case. Following the publication of my post on May 26th, 2020 I received interesting feedback and reactions. Some reached out with sincere concerns (mostly my family and friends), and others reached out to me wearing their Human Rights costumes with warnings. Apparently, I was in danger for voicing my experience with the police😒.What happened was quite the opposite. In a span of a day, I was contacted by most Gov officials including CTO Belise and and DCGP Namuhoranye, all trying to understand what had happened and details about where I was. A meeting was held to find out what had gone wrong. I was later contacted to testify and due to Covid19 restrictions, I did it remotely.To say that I was mortified would be an understatement. I was sweating bullets, already wondering if I will manage sleeping in a room confinement again. But I knew I had said the truth and had stated verifiable facts. And indeed, they had not only investigated the incident but they had done a meeting with RDB to clearly map out and define in the Rwandan context the meaning of a BAR. During the meeting, they agreed on the role of RDB as a regulator of the Hospitality & Tourism Industry and RNP as law enforcement entity. What I was NOT prepared to hear however was an apology and a promise for a better implementation of the restrictive measures. I may or may have not cried a little out of emotions.I couldn't deny the fact that some of my ""inmates"" were clearly drunk at the time of the arrest. Some had gotten used to spending time at the stadium and return back to where they had been arrested the following day. Something had to be done. (Yep, you can't avoid seeing your spouse for that long) In other words, if you, ungrateful Basinzi managed to drink without going through 5days sleeping in a 4x5m room, you ought to THANK ME! If you see me this weekend, I expect you to buy me a drink, inyama and pay umusare to take us home.Fun fact,   and I became friends during that period, we created a WhatsApp group to stay connected with other women we were together. If you see me hugging some policemen, mind your business please, I became friends with couple of them but that has never stopped them to issue me a fine when I overspeed.As to those who think that giving a constructive feedback to RNP can land you in jail, perhaps you should first learn how to communicate decently and improve your critical thinking? I am myself still working on that but I am now comforted to know that their involvement in my case meant that my voice was heard.Ngaho, let's now enjoy our weekend, responsibility 🤗"

COVID-19,0,"In general, both platelets and neutrophils on their own are considered to be major actors in the prothrombotic state seen in COVID-19 and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). With our understanding of thromboinflammation still evolving, further efforts should be directed towards dissecting the precise mechanisms of direct and indirect platelet-neutrophil interplay. From the authors' point of view, this relationship should be seen as bidirectional with both types of cells closely interacting and potentiating the thrombotic cascade of initiation, formation and extension of thrombosis. Detailed insights into this interaction and its pathways could be used to design targeted therapies that reduce the occurrence of life-threatening thrombotic complications in COVID-19 and VITT. Additional research on the role of low-density neutrophils (LDNs) may help limit the consequences of hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19. In vitro thrombosis models, such as microfluidic systems, might be helpful in this regard to understand the role of different cells in the development of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 as well as VITT."

COVID-19,0,"via  In the climate of a global pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out under emergency use authorization after a much shorter than normal testing period. Millions of people rolled up their sleeves because they were told they were doing their part to end the pandemic. But for some—it didn’t go as expected. The Unseen Crisis is a feature-length documentary that provides an intimate, uncensored look into the lives of those who live with the debilitating after-effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. It examines the issue of COVID-19 vaccine injury claims in a fresh, honest, and comprehensive manner with expert interviews, whistleblowers’ statements, and government health statistics.         This is a documentary about people, not politics.The patients in the documentary suffered severe reactions to the shot and their health spiraled out of control. When they reached out to the public health system and pharmaceutical companies for help and support, instead of being acknowledged, cared for, and studied; they were ignored, censored, and called “anti-vaxxers” despite having gotten the shot. These patients are by no means isolated cases. The world is witnessing a growing epidemic of COVID-19 vaccine injuries that can no longer be ignored. Fortunately, a small community of doctors are bravely trying to unravel the mystery of these injuries and how to treat them. They too were shocked to find themselves shut out of the mainstream medical community, simply for practicing what every doctor is trained to do. But ultimately, The Unseen Crisis is a story of hope and triumph. In spite of everything, this group has learned to rely on themselves and work together to find relief. Determined, principled, and surprisingly positive, they truly embody the resilient American spirit.For those suffering in silence, hope begins with having a voice. The “Unseen Crisis” finally gives them one.Official Website:"

COVID-19,0,"Statement on the antigen composition of COVID-19 vaccines | WHO  The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to meet regularly to assess the implications of SARS-CoV-2 evolution for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition and advise WHO on whether changes are needed to the antigen composition of future COVID-19 vaccines. As of May 2023, XBB.1 descendent lineages predominate SARS-CoV-2 circulation globally. In order to improve protection, in particular against symptomatic disease, new formulations of COVID-19 vaccines should aim to induce antibody responses that neutralize XBB descendent lineages.  One approach recommended by TAG-CO-VAC is the use of a monovalent XBB.1 descendent lineage, such as XBB.1.5 (e.g., hCoV-19/USA/RI-CDC-2-6647173/2022, GenBank: OQ054680.1, GISAID: EPI_ISL_16134259 or WHO Biohub: 2023-WHO-LS-01, GenBank: OQ983940, GISAID EPI_ISL_16760602) as the vaccine antigen. Given the small genetic and antigenic differences from XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 (e.g., hCoV-19/USA/MI-CDC-LC1038976/2023, GenBank: OQ931660 GISAID: EPI_ISL_17619088) may be an alternative. The spike antigens of both of these lineages are genetically and antigenically very closely related, with only two amino acid differences between XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 (E180V and T478R).  Other formulations and/or platforms that achieve robust neutralizing antibody responses against XBB descendent lineages can be considered."

Group: Besties  
What we have done during the hackathon:
1. Web scraping
2. Data cleansing and preprocessing
3. Using LLM to classify social media posts
4. Classification model to identify disease-related posts: We used a pretrained Bert model and train it with 1000 rows of data
5. Final classification model: We used PyCaret to build the classification model to classify if a crisis occurs on a day
